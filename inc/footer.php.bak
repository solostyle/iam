		<p><em>About Me:</em> Marketing teams input produce cross purposing in view of goal alignments due to knowlege paucity, necessitating workflow education and orientation. Media sourcing as an acquistion strategy is counterproductive in a internet environment in virtual component methodology. Imaging through ideals rather than real world branding, is a perilous undertaking with negative results. Branding strategies generating motion as activity without reproducible results is a ultimately futile effort if left in place.</p>
		<p>Enterprise engenderment accelerates initiative platforms, reducing staffing components, integration of technical accessibility, resulting in bottom line pluralisms, benefit-wise. Incidental re-sizing staff requirements through attrition can be accelerated by paridigm shifts and focusing on core suitability and cross-training.</p>
