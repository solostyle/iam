			<h2>Ear pulse, knee bruise</h2>
			<h3>19 January 2007  @ 16:52</h3>
			<p>Today's personal trainer, Mark Vives, lined up a set with absolutely no breaks, similar to Tuesday's Ben. But this time the cardiovascular workout was much more intense. My muscles can handle repeated stress only so well when my heart is tired. So, while I accomplished more in less time, I felt less capable of completing everything. Satisfaction is important to me, and I would rather feel that I conquered a difficult workout than feel that I failed at an extremely difficult one.</p><p>Toward the end of our fifty-five minutes together, I started hearing and feeling a pulse in my ear. I could feel a lot of pressure just under my ears along the sides of my neck. This was the first time I ever felt it, and Mark said it was probably because I was tired. Well, here's what the <a href="http://aids.healthlink.mcw.edu/article/901226039.html">Medical College of Wisconsin</a> says:<br /><blockquote>When healthy people are over-tired or over-heated, they also may hear a pulse beat in the ear. Remember that the carotid arteries, which are big blood vessels carrying blood from your heart to your brain, run on either side of your neck, close to your ears. [<a href="http://aids.healthlink.mcw.edu/article/901226039.html">from here</a>]</blockquote></p><p>Right. So. Given that I've had some amazing workouts in my life and never felt a pulse in my ear, this is probably a warning sign. Meh, actually it isn't so bad, because I feel fine. But I would rather stay below this threshold. I would recommend the same to anyone else.</p><p>So far I've had an easy workout, a perfect workout, and an overkill. I think I now know what I would do to balance my own workout without a personal trainer. The biggest lesson is that a strength-training day doesn't have to be just anaerobic. I can make it as intense as a purely aerobic workout and feel much more fluid and target every part of my body.</p><p>Another thing is that both Ben and Mark did full-body strength-training (as well as getting the heart-rate up)--and these were three days apart. Instead of doing different muscle groups each day, we did them all each day. I was still strong today, even though we worked until total fatigue. I just wonder about that...</p><p>Also, geez.. this is the worst.. I banged a door against my right knee. It's fine, but hurts when I walk. Bah! I must remember to be gentle with everything.</p>
