			<h2>A swirling mess</h2>
			<h3>13 January 2007  @ 21:19</h3>
			<p>My body is in a lot of pain. Since I got back to Chicago from Houston, where I stayed for the month of December, I've been miserable. I'm almost always on the verge of crying or screaming. Right now as I type, my pelvis hurts everywhere, all the lower back muscles feel like they've been through a train wreck. My right shin, not the muscle but the bone, has started getting sharp pain, making it hard to walk. The stress fracture in my left foot makes it hard to walk as well. Although I'm wearing orthotics, it seems like I still waddle and compensate when I walk. I can't just relax and walk naturally.</p><p>I need to get this out. Tonight I'm going to meditate with qi gong for as much of an hour as I can, trying to focus on nothing but breathing no matter what the pain. Then tomorrow morning, I'll take the el up to the gym. I'm going to swim and do light resistance.</p><p>After exercising, I have an appointment with Clint Philips, whose websites I want to improve. Then I'll bike in the snow to the Metra and take it home, clean up the apartment, and show it to two interested people.</p><p>If I can get through tomorrow doing all that (and doing what I need to do tonight, too), I can at least be happy for a while. Maybe the psychological relief and success of simply doing those things will help ease the physical pain.</p><p>I wish someone would help me.</p>
