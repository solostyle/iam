			<h2>Today's workout</h2>
			<h3>22 January 2007  @ 19:16</h3>
			<p>I don't know if I remember this in order. In fact I'm pretty sure this isn't in order, but I'm sure that everything is included.</p><p><em>Warm up</em><br /><ol><br /><li>Shuffle sideways around the boxing ring, switching directions each time, making 8 (or 10?) loops total</li><br /><li>Lunges with side shoulder raises, one loop around boxing ring</li><br /><li>Lunges with no weights, one loop</li><br /><li>10 pushups with one hand on a medicine ball, switching the ball from one hand to the other each pushup</li><br /><li>30 incline crunches</li><br /><li>10 pushups with both hands on medicine ball (triangle pushups)</li><br /><li>15 leg raises on incline</li><br /></ol></p><p><em>Main workout</em><br /><ol><br /><li>Bench press with dumbbells (15 reps) + Seated stationary row (15 reps)-- alternate these two sets and repeat 2 more times</li><br /><li>Knee raises (20 reps)</li><br /><li>Lunge jumps for 30 seconds-- basically you lunge, and then jump to switch legs and lunge again</li><br /><li>Knee raises, obliques (lift knees up and twist to the side) 20 reps</li><br /><li>Step ups! This block was about 2.5 feet tall, you step up with one foot, without landing the other foot, and back down, switch</li><br /><li>Lat pull down with arms as wide as possible (15 reps) + clean and press (15 reps)-- alternate these two sets and repeat one or two more times</li><br /><li>Dips (15 reps) + Hammer curls (15 reps)-- alternate and repeat</li><br /><li>15 lat raises, first lifting straight out in front, then opening up chest and moving arms out to the sides, then back to center and down</li><br /><li>Shuffle bear! Shuffle on hands and feet, with your rear as low as it can go, around a little obstacle course</li><br /><li>15 lat raises again</li><br /><li>Shuffle bear again</li><br /><li>Plank position with hands on exercise ball (20 seconds) + roll out putting the ball under knees, and placing hands out in front like a pushup position, and crunch while keeping back flat and bending knees to chest, rolling the ball along under you (10 reps) -- alternate and repeat</li><br /><li>Run up and down stairs (22 steps) 9 times, with a one minute break every three times. I did an extra one at the end to make it 10 times</li><br /><li>Jack-knife situps while passing exercise ball between hands and feet (1 minute)</li><br /><li>Catching a medicine ball and twisting to one side while passing it back (10 times, each side)</li><br /><li>Turkish getups using a kettle bell (5 on each side): lie flat on the mat holding the bell in right hand straight up in the air, elbow almost locked. Using left hand and right foot, get up to a stand, keeping the bell straight up in the air. Then slowly get back down again and lie down. Pull the bell to your chest and pass it to the left hand.</li><br /><li>Kettle bell toss (10 on each side, 2 sets): stand with legs wide apart, knees slightly bent, hold the bell in one hand, let it hang down between your legs with your back straight. Then thrust your hips forward while lifting the bell straight up overhead, and let it flip back and hit your wrist. Bring the arm back down and switch hands.</li><br /></ol></p><p>I felt the pulse in my right ear again, but it wasn't as painful as last Thursday. My left shoulder really ached today, burned. More than the right. I'm left handed, so I thought my left would be stronger than my right. It probably is, but I also have always known my left shoulder to be tighter and less flexible. Maybe that's why it hurt more?</p><p>When it hurts that much, I wonder if I'm getting enough of a workout for the target muscles. Like when I was doing dips, I felt it more in my shoulders than in my triceps. The Shuffle Bear was hard because I had to lock my shoulder to stay up.</p><p>Hopefully all that protein that I ate today will help repair it!</p><p>I was tired after 20 minutes. Even after 15. I took more breaks today than last Thursday, and that helped me get through the workouts. I also got slightly better at enduring muscular pain. There's a natural repulsion to completing a really difficult set, but I was able to quiet my mind and just do it no matter how much I wanted to quit.</p>
