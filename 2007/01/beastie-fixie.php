			<p>I have a new project. Caleb and I have been working on a new bike for me! It is one of the many projects I have in mind to do in the near future. The first bike I need is another fixed gear bike, and one that will cost little more than $300.</p><p>We just bought a nice old Schwinn bike from eBay for a little over a hundred dollars. </p><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/new_schwinn.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/new_schwinn.jpg"  /></a></p><p>We also got some new Ritchey 24-spoke wheels. Very nicely trued and good quality rims.</p><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/new_wheels.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/new_wheels.jpg"  /></a></p><p>Now Caleb lives, with his myriad bikes and bike parts, in Baltimore (where we used to live). He's a friend of my sister and a huge bike-enthusiast (read: bike-freak). He will be putting the bike together, but keeping me in the loop.</p><p>The next project will be to convert my existing Surly fixie</p><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/surly_beast.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/surly_beast.jpg"  /></a></p><p>into a nice geared cyclo-cross bike (which I guess it was meant to be).</p><p>I also want a nice track frame with sweet wheels--definitely an expensive project. I'm thinking.. around $1000. After that, a fixed BMX bike with crazy knobbly tires and straight bars.</p>
