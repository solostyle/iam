			<h2>Lateral Forces</h2>
			<h3>28 January 2007  @ 21:50</h3>
			<p>Today I found out that my right leg can handle more lateral force than before. Last Tuesday Ben made me do the side plank with the top leg off the ground, putting all the weight on the taut bottom ankle and one forearm. It was easy on the left side, but very painful on the right. To be exact, the pain was concentrated in the middle of the leg, including the shin and some parts of the medial side of the tibia.</p><p>I tried it one more time on Friday, and it still hurt about the same, but I was used to the pain. Tonight, after coming home from the airport, I tried it again. There's still some pain getting into and out of the position, but while I'm up, if I position myself a certain way, the leg doesn't hurt.</p>
