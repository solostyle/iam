			<p>Because I might one-up you. In a couple of months I'm going to be <em>cut</em>.</p><p>PHEW! Today, (crap, I can barely type, even my finger extensors and flexors burn) Ben, one of Clint's trainers, kicked my butt within the first ten minutes of our glorious hour together. Here's what he made me do, with hardly any break in between:</p><p><ol><br /><li>military pushups - 15</li><br /><li>triangle pushups- 5</li><br /><li>forward lunges around the boxing ring, 15 lb curls in each arm</li><br /><li>shoulder press while twisting left and right (I am generally weary of twisting but these didn't seem harmful to the spine)</li><br /><li>backward lunges around the boxing ring, also with 15 lb curls - ~10 alternating</li><br /><li>toe touches (lie on back, legs straight up, crunch up while reaching for toes) - ~100</li><br /><li>renegade pushups with 7.5 lb dumbbells (pushup, lift left side, pushup, lift right side... killer!) - ~5 on each side (couldn't handle any more!)</li><br /><li>bent over row with 15 lb wts, followed by curls (or hammer curls), 3 times total - 12 and 8 reps</li><br /><li>toe touches with 15 lb weights (or was it 7.5?), legs apart, reaching for the opposite foot - ~30 or so alternating</li><br /><li>clean and press with either 15 or 7.5 lb weights (can't remember!) - ~20 or so</li><br /><li>hindu squats with 7.5 lb dumbbells - ~30 or so</li><br /><li>leg raises while he pushes my legs back down</li><br /><li>leg raises left, center, right (works the hips, but it didn't strain, thankfully. maybe it helps break up scar tissue) - ~15 alternating? seemed like 20-25</li><br /><li>pushups again, 5 slow seconds between each - ~15 (but I needed several breaks)</li><br /><li>dips on some parallel bars - ~25 reps, 2 sets</li><br /><li>lat pull down - ~12 reps @ 55 lbs, 4 sets</li><br /></ol></p><p>We got through it all in about an hour, slightly less. I drank maybe a cup of water because I just had no time for more. Seriously after most of those exercises, I was dead, not just muscularly but cardiovascularly. Most of the time, it was the cardio that killed me. But I recovered pretty quickly after stopping each set.</p><p>I wonder how it would change if I did some light cardio before starting a workout like this. Maybe help?</p><p>Then he gave me a 3 day split to follow.</p><p><ul><br /><li><em>Chest, shoulders, triceps</em></li><br /><li>flat bench</li><br /><li>incline bench</li><br /><li>fly</li><br /><li>lat raise (arm straight, out to side)</li><br /><li>front raise (arm straight, out in front)</li><br /><li>shoulder press</li><br /><li>dips</li><br /><li>triangle pushups (? maybe I added that)</li><br /><li>cable press down</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li><em>Legs, abs</em></li><br /><li>hindu squats</li><br /><li>leg extension</li><br /><li>leg curl</li><br /><li>calf press</li><br /><li>toe touch</li><br /><li>oblique toe touch</li><br /><li>knee raises</li><br /><li>be creative with abs</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li><em>Back, biceps</em></li><br /><li>dead lift</li><br /><li>good mornings (what I previously thought were dead lifts, but aren't)</li><br /><li>arm curls (using that bench with the arm rest)</li><br /><li>bent over row</li><br /><li>curls, hammer curls</li><br /></ul></p><p>And a protein shake before and after. I should get a gram of protein per lb that I weigh. That's way more protein than I have been eating.</p><p>I just had a big lunch and now I'm hungry again. Should I eat the rest of this protein bar? Hmm.. But what if hunger pangs happen because you stretch your stomach out (like after a big lunch) and feel empty, not because you need tne nutrition?</p><p>So much more to learn about my body!</p><p>Today's workout didn't hurt my joints or bones one iota. Talk about encouragement!</p>
