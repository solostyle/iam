			<h2>Screw taste</h2>
			<h3>22 January 2007  @ 19:03</h3>
			<p>Yesterday I ate what I normally eat, and my macrobiotic proportions were:<br /><ul><br /><li>Protein: 11%</li><br /><li>Carbs: 75%</li><br /><li>Fat: 14%</li><br /></ul></p><p>I couldn't believe it! That's a normal day of food, without working out, and without thinking about macrobiotics. Today I went out of my way to pay close attention to the macrobiotic content of everything I ate, and here are the proportions:<br /><ul><br /><li>Protein: 26%</li><br /><li>Carbs: 52%</li><br /><li>Fat: 22%</li><br /></ul></p><p>But to get there, I had to eat some pretty unsatisfying stuff. I ate two Clif Builder's bars, which taste good if you eat them a few times a week but feel strange in your body when you eat them the way I did today. I also bought some Soy Protein Powder to put in some drinks. The problem is, I should have gotten whey or egg protein! I realized it only after I came home and thought about it. You shouldn't eat more than 25g of soy protein a day. That means I can't really eat a full serving of this stuff. I also already drink soymilk with my oatmeal and I eat tofu every now and then.</p><p>Sigh. Well, even though it was $15 for this can of protein, it's more important to eat properly than to finish it.</p><p>By the way, I couldn't drink a whole glass (one serving) anyway because of the weird taste. I thought I could just suck it up and endure (it was Vanilla-flavored, too!) but alas, my tolerance waned with each sip.</p><p><em>Even still</em>, I couldn't make it up to 30% Protein today! I wish I didn't have a tongue, or a desire to eat things that taste good. What is taste, anyway? The nutrients in the foods I eat, the proportions, the timing, the exercise--that's the stuff that matters. Taste should be at the bottom of the list.</p>
