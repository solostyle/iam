			<h2>Tibia plate</h2>
			<h3>24 August 2007  @ 19:55</h3>
			<p>This plate in my leg is really annoying. It has to go. It seems more annoying now than it did before because now that my left foot is better, the right leg is all the more pronounced. Also I feel like starting a new life in good health, so I want to get this damn thing removed. I wake up in the middle of the night in pain, it aches when I walk, and it pinches and pokes when I do pushups and when I extend my knee horizontally using the quadriceps.</p><p>I really hope my current orthopedic surgeon can do this surgery. I'm sure he has the hardware to get the screws out. It just takes a screwdriver and a bunch of bits of different sizes. Even I could do it. Okay, no, I probably couldn't, because I don't know how to cut through the muscle and ligaments with the least damage.</p><p>This time I'm going to remember to save the hardware that he removes. The last surgery, I forgot to ask him to save the fractured bone. How cool would it be to keep all your old bones? I could have put it in a glass case or something and made a little museum-like shelf in my room.</p>
