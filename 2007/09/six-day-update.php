			<h2>Six day update</h2>
			<h3>26 September 2007  @ 20:17</h3>
			<p>I spent this morning exercising my leg a little. I've been sleeping a lot these past two nights. I hope I sleep another 9 or 10 hours tonight. I think it's good for my body right now. </p><p>I spent the afternoon reading about probiotics' effect on the immune system and nutritional remedies for a few diseases (IBS, ulcerative colitis, other bowel diseases). Then I decided to try eating dinner. Eating.. what a pain it is these days. I wish I could just take a saline solution with all my required stuff. </p><p>I went for a one mile walk this evening after dinner. There was a bit of pain on the inside of my knee, where the screws used to be. Time will tell if that's just what I'll have to live with forever or something that will go away. There was a bit of stiffness, but that's probably from the inflammation and lymph activity going on right now. Here are some <a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/leg/day6/">pictures</a> of the leg. I didn't take pictures while walking, though that would have been nice.</p><p></p>
