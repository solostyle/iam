			<p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/leg/">Pictures</a> of my leg with the wraps off, sans stitches. Here's a preview of a few of them:<br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/leg/01.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/leg/01_small.jpg"></a><br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/leg/04.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/leg/04_small.jpg"></a><br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/leg/07.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/leg/07_small.jpg"></a><br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/leg/10.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/leg/10_small.jpg"></a></p><p>.. and the accompanying story. On Sept 20, I had the plate and screws removed, all twelve of the colorful nasty buggers. As you can <a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/leg/plate.jpg">see</a> they're long. And they were running crosswise through my tibia. Hello! Foreign objects! In my body! Whoa!</p><p>I want a nice pretty scar that isn't all puffy--not for cosmetics, but because scar tissue that forms under those big puffy scars can block nerve growth, become cancerous in rare cases, can lose sensation, and can cause pain if it blocks other things. All in all it just sounds like it's worth preventing.</p><p>I'm able to walk a bit. It's only been 3.5 days. I don't much mind if the doctor gets upset at me. This is it. I'm taking it into my own hands.</p>
