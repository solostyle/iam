			<p>For the first time in several years, my parents finally watched me swim this evening. My routine included the four strokes and flip-turns. Unfortunately I was pooped after half an hour, but at least they got to see the different strokes. At my fastest, I get down to about 18 seconds when doing freestyle for 25 yards. I can keep up the speed for about five minutes, and then I slow down. My coach, Tish, tells me of people who can do a full lap (50 yards) butterfly under 30 seconds. My butterfly for 25 yards is around 20 seconds, but I can't do a full lap at that speed.</p><p>My parents were encouraging as usual, and full of compliments.</p><p>I want to be an amazing swimmer. Just because I started later in life than the really good ones doesn't mean I can't try. Unfortunately, I started about 10 years later than I should have. And even then I didn't swim hardcore until I was 18. Today at the doctor's office I saw a picture in Newsweek (March 2007) of a swimmer that captured something of the sleekness and power that I feel when I swim.</p><p><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/swimmer_newsweek.jpg" /></p>
