			<h2>Another surgery?</h2>
			<h3>29 June 2007  @ 21:51</h3>
			<p>The last time I had seen <a href="http://houstonortho.com/MeettheDoctors/DavidBloome.htm">Dr. Bloome</a>, orthopedic surgeon, was December 2006. Today he took more x-rays, and said they looked the same. But to me, they looked different! I never remembered seeing a complete break all the way through the sesamoid bone. The break looks like a straight line horizontally through the bone, with the distal (further from the ankle) piece slightly larger.</p><p>The first x-ray I saw in Chicago looked like little pock-marks cratering the pea-sized bone. The second x-ray I saw at Dr. Vargas' office looked like a small quadrant had chipped off, what would be the top left quadrant when I look down at my foot. Now, it looks like a clean break all the way through from left to right, separating the bone into two hemispheres.</p><p>This is a bit annoying.</p><p>We discussed some options. I brought in the Exogen bone stimulating ultrasound device that I bought off Ebay and received four days ago.</p><p><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/exogen.jpg" /></p><p>He told me he uses this type of device frequently with his patients and that it seems to have some solid research backing it up. Some doctors swear by it and others think it's hocus pocus. He says there hasn't been any research done specifically on whether nonunion fractures in sesamoids of the foot benefit from this treatment. But he does think it may be worth a shot. I've waited this long anyway, so I might as well try since it certainly won't hurt.</p><p>The other option is surgery. Whenever I talk to surgeons about surgery, they always seem to describe the actual procedure in as harmless a way as possible. As if that's what matters! I don't give two shits about whether the procedure itself hurts or takes 3 hours or requires in-patient care or anaesthesia. I've been through enough serious procedures for that not to matter to me.</p><p>But even if I hadn't had so many surgeries, I think I would still be more concerned about the aftermath of surgery, the way life does or does not go on. Surgery is quick, life is long. Dr. Bloome seemed somewhat confident that I would be able to return to normal activity relatively quickly. There's a little risk that I might lose some flexing power in the big toe, but there's only a slight chance that the toe could shift to the left or the right.</p><p>By flexing power, he meant the ability to bend the toe downward (toward the heel) as you do when pushing off the ground. I had misunderstood this at first, thinking it meant the ability to bend the toe upward, toward the shin.</p><p>He even said I could go on running. Oh boy. I doubt I ever will, even if my toe post-surgery allows me to. I don't want to risk any further damage. I'm doing just fine with the swimming. And maybe once I have this surgery done, I can start biking again. What a relief that will be! I love biking more than I could love a sentient being. I shudder to think that, but it feels true.</p><p>At least at present.</p><p>I will be tossing these options around in my head for the next 4-6 weeks, and during that time I'll continue the daily ultrasound treatment that I pray will yield happy results.</p>
