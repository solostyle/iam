			<h2>I bought my first car</h2>
			<h3>28 June 2007  @ 12:41</h3>
			<p>In the interest of going biodiesel or wvo in the future when I might have time and energy for such an adventure, I purchased a 1985 Mercedes-Benz 300D Turbo Diesel today.</p><p>I need my own car because I will employed in a potentially distant location, and commute is difficult on bike or foot with my current injury.</p><p>I drove it home just a couple of hours ago, a good 15 or so miles, the furthest I have driven it so far. It feels so smooth at 40 mph that I feel like I am only going 30. At 60, it is still quiet, with that high pitched diesel hum that you often hear with in those big trucks.</p><p>I still need to check the speedometer to make sure the speeds match up with other cars that I know are right. The car had 274,062 miles on it when I bought it, but I hope it lasts for at least another 200,000. The odometer and the clock still work, which is rare for these older cars. The speakers sound good, the tires have around 10,000 miles on them, the body has not been painted or worked on, and the window and seat adjustments all currently work. They also do not seem difficult to repair if wires get damaged.</p><p>I am not a snob about this car. Yes, it is one of those classy German imports from around the time of my birth, but to me it is primarily a diesel engine with a pre-combustion chamber that may prove to be dependable, sturdy, and fun to learn about. I wish it were manual transmission, but my foot would protest that for sure.</p><p>Speaking of the foot, I might get a tattoo of a crown on my ankle to signify its importance. Sad and funny, but true: everything I do is for my foot. My foot is the reason I hesitate to get a job far away (who would hesitate with such an incredible offer as I have received?); my foot is the reason I have to buy a car; my foot is the reason swimming is the only chance I get for exercise; my foot may even be the reason I feel so ungrounded, uncertain, depressed, anxious, and emotionally dependent. My foot is the one part of my body that gets royal treatment, and a crown tattoo would help me and others remember that.</p>
