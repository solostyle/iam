			<h2>Walking, my foot!</h2>
			<h3>12 March 2007  @ 17:15</h3>
			<p>I just saw a new podiatrist today, Dr. Vargas. He booted my left foot so that it is immobilized, taking the pressure off the sesamoids. They are used to push off, flexing the big toe upward. This force causes strain for me, so it feels better not to use that action. Tomorrow or the day after I'll be getting an MRI to see the activity in the tissues and bones around the area. Hopefully some good will come of this gleaning.</p><p>In other news, I had a rockin day with two really fun girls, Roopa and Yashoda. They brought over a keyboard and an electric guitar. I had my acoustic and my drums. We took turns rotating around playing different instruments. Sort of jammed together. It helped me loosen up a bit, but I hope I get good enough to mess around a bit more. There is so much I want to play but I feel like I'm not fast or skilled enough. I want to be awesome by Saturday for my next drum lesson.</p><p>The poor flowers are still unplanted. It stormed a huge sneeze last night, waking me up from a dream. It will likely do the same tonight. I might just hold off until Wednesday to install the cuties into their new homes.</p>
