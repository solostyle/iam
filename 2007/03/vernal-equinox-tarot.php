			<h2>Vernal Equinox Tarot</h2>
			<h3>22 March 2007  @ 09:26</h3>
			<p>I want to share the highlights of one of the most beautiful tarot readings I can remember having. Its beauty was sweetened even more so by the fading bitterness of spite and fear. It marked a change and a time for moving into the light.<br />I used my favorite spread, the Celtic Cross:<br /><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=8,0,0,0" width="424" height="360" id="celtic_cross" align="middle"><br /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain" /><br /><param name="movie" value="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/celtic_cross.swf" /><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#e4d3c2" /><embed src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/celtic_cross.swf" quality="high" bgcolor="#e4d3c2" width="424" height="360" name="celtic_cross" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="sameDomain" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /><br /></object><br /><p>Below are some of my favorite lines from the descriptions of the cards.</p><br /><p class="dream"><em>Card 1: Integration</em></p><br /><p class="dream">This is a time of communication between the previously experienced dualities of life. Rather than night opposing day, dark suppressing light, they work together to create a unified whole, turning endlessly one into the other, each containing in its deepest core the seed of the opposite.</p><br /><p>I'm able to see suffering and breakthrough in this way again.</p><br /><p class="dream"><em>Card 2: Healing</em></p><br /><p class="dream">Be aware of your wound. . . . and it will be healed only when you move to the roots. The less the head, the more the wound will heal; with no head there is no wound. Life a headless life.</p><br /><p class="dream"><em>Card 3: We Are The World</em></p><br /><p class="dream">When you cry and weep, when you are miserable, you are alone. When you celebrate, the whole existence participates with you.</p><br /><p>Not sure I agree, because I feel like most of the time people don't want to celebrate. Friends will celebrate with you, and you with them. But friends will also weep with you, and you with them. So, while I generally do feel alone when I'm miserable, I know even then that I'm really not alone.</p><br /><p class="dream"><em>Card 4: Conditioning</em></p><br /><p class="dream">... make a move and break out of whatever you have been conditioned by others to believe about yourself. Dance, run, jog, do gibberish - whatever is needed to wake up the sleeping lion within.... Society will not tolerate individuality, because individuality will not follow like a sheep. Individuality has the quality of the lion; the lion moves alone</p><br /><p>A kind of awkward way of saying something very simple: find your way.</p><br /><p class="dream"><em>Card 5: Inner Voice</em></p><br /><p class="dream">If you have found your truth within yourself there is nothing more in this whole existence to find. Truth is functioning through you.</p><br /><p>This helped me understand that even lies are truth. All is truth because everything is governed by that inner voice. You only have to go deep to find where it is all coming from, and when you find this inner voice, everything is necessary--everything is perfect.</p><br /><p class="dream"><em>Card 6: Sharing</em></p><br /><p class="dream">When you draw this card, it suggests that you are in a situation where you have an opportunity to share your love, your joy, and your laughter. And in sharing, you find that you feel even more full.... You find that you can enjoy sensuality without possessiveness or attachment, can give birth to a child or a new project with an equal sense of creativity fulfilled.</p><br /><p>Yeah, I realized this before I drew the card. It was nice to have it confirmed. When I have joy I am empowered through my ability to share. Instead of needing and asking all the time.</p><br /><p class="dream"><em>Card 7: Slowing Down</em></p><br /><p class="dream">If desires and hopes and dreams are fading away, so much the better. Their disappearance is making space for a new quality of stillness and acceptance of what is, and you are able to welcomethis development in a way you have never been able to before.</p><br /><p>Yup, I am able to just be happy as I am, regardless of all these things I can't do anymore. Finally I can rest and just exist.</p><br /><p class="dream"><em>Card 8: Guilt</em></p><br /><p class="dream">The moment, this herenow, is forgotten when you start thinking in terms of achieving something. When the achieving mind arises, you lose contact with the paradise you are in.</p><br /><p>We feel guilty when we make mistakes. But stop trying to do anything in particular, and you won't make mistakes anymore. You'll just do what you do and notice it. You'll learn as you go, and you'll really look at what is good or bad about it rather than impulsively judging.</p><br /><p class="dream"><em>Card 9: The Miser</em></p><br /><p>Nothing to share here.</p><br /><p class="dream"><em>Card 10: Innocence</em></p><br /><p>I want this resurrection of innocence that often only happens after you live life fully and learn to drop all knowledge. Then you can really enjoy everything without thinking about anything. It is different from the ignorance of childhood. It is the wise acceptance of change.</p><br /></p>
