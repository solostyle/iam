			<h2>Irrational people never end</h2>
			<h3>14 March 2007  @ 21:12</h3>
			<p>it's getting to be harder to write. every day. i question whether i should even bother to do it anymore. will i learn anything? will anything good come of it? is it just idle finger movement? something to escape this growing emptiness that would be welcome if only it weren't under the command of confusion, doubt, and fear. but i realized something tonight.. that what i don't know, what i doubt, what i fear, and what confuses me no one can ever know. it's the mystery of life itself, it's the unborn moment that i approach with such trembling, gaping eyes. </p><p>i ask.. is it getting better day by day? how can one know? does the increased frequency of emotional outbursts and spontaneous crying mean it is getting worse? does it mean anything? I feel so helpless when it happens, as if something else is usurping my spirit and trying to defeat me. i don't fight, as much as i'd like to be more combative i simply can't. i'm too careful with myself to deal flippantly with these matters. i fear that whatever this is, every time it happens, it might be breaking another brick of support that i had built. </p><p>i thought i was strong. i thought without a doubt that i would get through this. just read my first blog entry on this website. you'll see.. you might even feel the force that coursed my veins and meridians then. i am not a constant person. i feel that i have changed tremendously over a very short period of time. all these me's seem so disparate that i can't decide which one to rely on. the dreamy, intuitive, intensely emotional, artistic, philosophical one? the athletic, physically obsessed, triathlete-bound, unassailable, will-of-indomitable-strength one? the independent, fiercely rebellious loner? the submissive, helpless, melancholy, sensitive, emotionally unstable, distrustful, and needy dependent one? the nurturing, compassionate, patient, faithful one?</p><p>and when i'm just existing, am i anything? am i only acting? why do each of these seem separate to me? is there a me out of all this that is steady and reliable? is there a characteristic somewhere here or unexpressed that i can believe in for myself? why do I need, if in fact I do, a me to rely on?</p><p>fuck me. i don't want any me at all. every me that i can think of is inadequate. i want the sky, i want the sunlight.. i want warmth, i want clear energy, i want air, i want to breathe clouds every morning at dawn. i want to sleep under the shade of night flowers, their whispers in my dreams. i want the earth's heartbeat. i want muddy footprints of bare feet on the sidewalk. i want splinters of tree bark. i want throbbing shoulders and callused fingers. i want veins like vines wrapping around my feet rooted in the ground. i want true love, the only kind of love--a love of existence, of the moment, of emptiness.</p><p>i want nothing.</p><p>in the end, absolutely nothing. and that's the hardest thing to have. it cannot be given or taken, bought or earned. will i be awake and ready when and if it comes my way? i can't even rely on myself that much. i wish all my bones were broken and i was tossed out in the desert naked with no one around. i might become a real person. as i am, i cling to too much, everything that i still have, when i should be relying on nothing.</p>
