			<h2>Burst of energy and beauty</h2>
			<h3>08 March 2007  @ 00:36</h3>
			<p>Tonight I went to the Explosions in the Sky concert at Numbers. For the first time in years I had an excellent time at a show. Though I was on crutches, standing while watching them play, shifting my weight, massaging my feet and knees every once in a while, I still got lost in the music. It's always surprising to hear music that touches you so deeply amongst hundreds of people who probably feel the same way.</p><p>Driving back home was memorable, too. It felt like a dream. It felt like I wasn't driving, that I was floating just barely above the surface of the road, frictionless. I don't know where I am right now. Am I dreaming?</p>
