			<h2>What beautiful rain</h2>
			<h3>13 March 2007  @ 22:09</h3>
			<p>I got to see mah bud Nicko today. Yay. And he had a wonderful thing to give me.... a HELLA ticket! Complete with Magik Markers, <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=81618827">Sunburned</a>, Gown, and Black Helicopter, whoever they are. Then I messaged my dear friend Matt at <a href="http://www.wnur.org/">WNUR</a> for some good Magik Markers tracks, and he used a nifty <a href="http://www.dropload.com">dropload</a> service to send them to me. These girls are worth seeing live, according to him.</p><p>Whee! Then this afternoon I played my drumz. I practiced guitar, too. I'm improving at guitar faster than at drums. I can play a blues scale in the key of A without stopping too long between notes. I should practice chord progressions, but I really want to be able to play strings of melodies (with some chords among the notes) that repeat themselves, evolving and changing slightly over time. </p><p>I thought I would plant the flowers tomorrow, but we planted them today. My parents and I dug in the dirt with our fingers and shovels, dropped the little rectangular-cup-shaped soil-and-root underparts of the flowers into their new homes, and patted them down gently. We worked quickly to beat the impending rain, but every chance I got to slow down and look at the flowers in their new homes, I felt a wave of feeling that I call the "death-by-cuteness" attack. If I looked at them any longer, I think all my insides would cave in and curl up into a warm sunny ball that would trap me indefinitely.</p><p>If it isn't pouring tomorrow, I think I might play the blues scale to my adorable, perky little new friends. I'm sure they'll love it! How could they not? They're so simple-hearted.</p>
