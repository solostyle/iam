			<h2>A little crazy</h2>
			<h3>12 July 2007  @ 17:35</h3>
			<p>I was a little crazy yesterday from all the thinking and feeling. I almost now don't want anyone to read it. That's what a journal is, I guess.. and words that capture the intensity of the moment. But, since I am my own friend, I understand why I felt those things. Some of them are things that I have been feeling for over a year now, off and on. Things that I never tried to express for fear of what they might mean. </p><p>So maybe it's quite simple. When you're stressed, you do go a little crazy, but it only seems that way from a non-stressed person's viewpoint. That means stepping back and looking at yourself, and seeing it happen. It is crazy. It was. To see the two people in me trying to have a conversation but stumbling over each other. I haven't perfected the split between them. They still both feel like one person, which confuses me. </p><p>Is it good that I've noticed that? What does it mean if that it's good? Does that mean it's better than falling into mental illness unaware? Some people have a double life, some have secret vices.. I guess multiple personalities is somewhat similar. Perhaps I can really make it my occupation to perfect the split. It may be helpful in surviving my life for the next long stretch.</p>
