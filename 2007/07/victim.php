			<h2>Victim</h2>
			<h3>15 July 2007  @ 17:44</h3>
			<p>I realize I write mostly when I feel intensely sad or unresolved. Once I think things through or time heals and resolves, my life feels stable again but I have no record of that positive shift. I write today because I feel good, and I have nothing to resolve, and because I want to remember how this feels.</p><p>I learned two lessons: how to give oral sex <em>and</em> that I should never again take a lesson from someone I don't madly love. Until I was back in the familiar arms of safety I didn't realize how much being touched by anyone else had affected me. It was almost traumatic.</p><p>Right now I feel whole. If everything ended tonight, if I left, if the world ended, I would welcome it. Every day should feel this complete. I ought to sleep at night feeling satisfied so that mornings feel truly fresh. Ah, I remember my childhood summer days were often that way.</p><p>So why "victim"? When I felt ungrounded earlier this week I turned to mysticism and universal cosmic spirituality (what other new-age terms can we add to that?) with a touch of psychiatric diagnosis. Among other remedies like simply talking to random people at the airport or in the cab, this helped give me some strength.</p><p>But right at this moment, none of that stuff applies, none of it helps, and all of it feels totally unnecessary. You might say, "of course since everything feels good now, those sorts of therapies are not necessary." But in fact, I can't say that any of that helped me get to how I feel now. I feel spiritually strong in a different, less conditional way. There are no rules about how I should behave at work, or how I austerely should live my life at home, or how to deal with being away from the persons I love. Thinking about those things helped a little, but I only needed those rules because I felt insecure with myself. I believe that I should strive for freedom, and the key to that is trust.</p><p>I've been a victim of many modes of thought. Doing that just digs me into a deeper hole. I only needed to be honest with my friend and feel loving toward myself and trusting toward life again. It was so so simple. My biggest demon is that I keep fearing that honesty about sadness and uncomfortable feelings will make my best friend sad and dislike me. Well who else am I going to talk to? No more of this, silly me.</p><p>All of a sudden the house across the street looks so white. It must be a trick of the twilight.</p>
