			<p>The local anesthesia is wearing off. I am starting to really feel it now. I just took an ibuprofen at 20:15. That's a pretty good long while that it lasted! I got out of the OR at around 8:50. So that's almost twelve hours. </p><p>The ibuprofen I took has 600mg of the drug in it. The usual OTC amount is 200-400mg per dose. So I definitely should be feeling the effects soon. </p><p>Right after surgery, I had loads of gas in me. I burped a couple of really big ones and felt instantly better. I wonder what that was all about? </p><p>Oh, now I'm starting to sneeze. What am I allergic to? Maybe that was too much ibuprofen?</p><p>Probably nothing. Stop being paranoid.</p><p>My foot feels weird. I can't really move the ankle around without feeling pinches because it is so swollen. The lower part of my shin is sore for some reason. Maybe they had to fix my foot in a pointed position during the surgery, which overstretched the shin. The cut is wrapped tightly in sticky, thick gauze. Over that, thinner gauze wrapped several times around the entire foot and ankle. And finally thick stretch cloth bandage around the foot and ankle affixed with a velcro strap.</p><p>I don't know what else to say. I could describe all the dreams that I had while resting this afternoon. I could, I could, but I won't.</p>
