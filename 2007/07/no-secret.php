			<p>... anymore. I don't care anymore who reads this thing. I have already made my decision about what I think about the people that I know who do currently read it, and even if I don't like them or want them to read it, I don't give a shit anymore. You waste your time the way you damn well please. And I will curse as much as I damn well want to. This blog is release for <em>me</em>, and I get a thrill out of sharing with the people I do want to read this.</p><p>And now (following the hostile shove-off) on to business. The proceeding is what I wrote in my journal today, and I did write many pages. It was another very introspective day.</p><p>[morning]</p><p>I worry that I will always have physical problems related to what I have now. I need to meet real people in the flesh--people who have had injuries and who keep themselves healthy and fit regardless. People who even continually challenge themselves to put up with difficult situations physically and still grow and overcome their fears and even their pain. I want so much more than ever to do rigorous martial arts, really strenuous mind-body exercises with a very difficult master. I also want to see a good chiropractor or naprapath at least twice a month to see how my bones are doing. I need a good general physician and a sports medicine doctor. I want to make health a top priority. <em>The</em> top. At least for the next few years. But most of all, I must meet people who know what this is like, people like me who challenge themselves and care for themselves as much as or more than I do. Forget confidentiality. Maybe there is a support group for injured athletes or victims of car accidents. I'm more of an injured athlete than a car accident victim. At least I think I would have more in common with the former group. But they usually get over their injuries, right? Maybe not. There was that lady at <acronym title="Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago">RIC</acronym> who saw me who had <acronym title="multiple sclerosis">MS</acronym> - she was a great athlete before MS.</p><p>60% of Americans say they are not happy. That's a lot of people. The main reason is they don't feel loved or loved enough or loved the way they want to be loved. I am probably among those. But first I have to love myself and feel strong. Before I can even make any claims or judgments on how others love me, I have to find my ground. I can't see clearly right now.</p><p>There is so much that I think about and so much that I need of a friend. If anyone gets close to me, it's really a big responsibility b/c there is always something on my mind that I need to talk about. If i really want to feel needed and cared for, I need the friend to contact me, to want to talk to me, to want to know that I care, and to want to tell me something. But no one really needs any of that from me, and if they do, it's maybe once a month. But I wouldn't even know how often it is that they need me because before long, I need them first. So I never know. I have never found out. I beg for people to call me and they promise they will, but they never have. I can't beg. I can't even ask. Because it isn't sincere even if they do call me. They have to feel the need, the urge, the desire to call me. Not just call me b/c I need it. If I do wait for that, it will be too late for me, because I need to talk way more often about things than do my friends. So it puts me at a disadvantage. If we only talk when they need it, when it's convenient for them, it will be way too inconvenient for me. And it will hurt me. It does hurt me. I can't take it anymore. I am going to put this in a letter and send it to Ooly.</p><p>[afternoon]</p><p>I'm at the airport. Whatever. I don't even live in the physical reality of moments anymore. Whenever I want to write or talk, I just want to go into my mind and resolve things. I still feel a knot. I don't think I'm just permanently very mentally oriented. I think I just have a lot to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grok">grok</a> right now. How much of this is because I'm a spoiled American brat? No.. Even if I am largely influenced by American ideals, I know I am a better person than that. I thought about what Arturo said... and what if I lived by those ideas? Are they incompatible with my current life? What I need right now is what I need. If I can't get it, I have to cope.</p><p>Duh--which is what I'm doing! Everything I write is lies. I need to make peace with everything--myself, my life, the world, people I don't like, people I do like, my wants and needs.</p><p>[on the plane]</p><p>Who is Sam Gaye? He had to wait all day at O'Hare United flight going to a wedding in Providence, RI - of his friend from school and his 1st job - white guy but really cool. Sam is from Liberia. His dad died in 1954 when he was very young so he always wants to remember his dad (hence the email which has 1954 in it). He advised me--told me to stand my ground, don't do things because other people at work invite you out. do what you want. He thinks I have good communication and people skills. I am open and honest when talking. He works for a Toyota dealership in the Bay Area. He said to keep in touch. gave me a hug. We spoke for maybe 30 minutes. I find that I really do get along well with good people. I talked to Arturo again this morning when he called. I forgot to call before flying out! Oh well. Again it was maybe helpful stuff that he said. </p><p>After talking to Sam Gaye and Arturo I feel a bit of strength. Arturo thinks I am a social person, that I need to be around people... I still don't know if that's true. I think I am very middle-of-the-road. I need equal amounts of people and alone time. And I would rather be alone than talk to or hang out with boring or frustrating people. And most people are boring or frustrating. Or at least people of my generation and slightly older. I have always gotten along better with people in their 50's than people in their 20's and 30's. Unless it's people like Derek, Kelly, Arturo, Sammy, Paul, Ooly. Actually anyone who is friendly, intelligent (very important), open-minded, generally cheerful, and genuinely caring--I get along with pretty easily. Obviously I do cherish all my precious alone-moments. There's always something to think about. But I find it intriguing that social interaction in a positive way actually gave me strength.</p><p>Maybe all the times that I don't enjoy, that don't give me strength... maybe I've just been around the wrong people. College kids, my friend's roommates, my other friend's gang of people. But people I meet in airports and on planes . . I don't know how it happens, but I almost always like them, and I even feel if we met outside the travel world, I would enjoy it more than I enjoy (or don't enjoy) the people I have hung out with thus far.</p><p>Or maybe the reason it gave me strength this time was because both Sam and Arturo said strengthening things. They seem like strong spiritual people. I want to keep meeting helpful interesting people. Usually it just happens. No one I've met who I've really liked happened b/c I or anyone planned it. Or was searching for it. My grammar was off on that one. Still makes sense, though. I feel like calling Gary. I've felt it for a long time now, but I bet he's in Peru or somewhere interesting. I need a really strong spiritual cleansing. I want to really work at everything troubling me, to see the truth, or the light, or whatever it is that helps give a sense of peace or capability. Last night.. no, this morning, early, I sat in the hotel bed and talked it out, as I usually do. (I wonder when I first started doing that? I feel like I always have, since I learned to talk.) Anyway.. I felt a really different feeling this morning while sitting there. I felt that I was truly my only real friend. That no one else would ever be there for me as much as myself. And that made me cry b/c the person crying and the person comforting were the same person. The cryer was comforting, and the comforter was crying. They shared each other's pain in empathic sincerity. I felt sorry for them both. Who is the "I"? Another separate viewer. There are so many me's these days. Not like when Kyle Cobb started numbering my mood swings, but now I've sort of started.. Have I started to schism into different actual people? Maybe under a lot of stress and no one to talk to, you just split into multiple people who all try to help each other, or the inflicted person(ality). In Psych speak, I believe it's called Dissociative Personality Disorder. But I wonder if this is really what DPD is. I read a bit about <acronym title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</acronym> patients and some of them became Dissociative. Sigh. I must be ... I don't know.. I guess I might understand now how that happens. Here we are. We have touched down.</p>
