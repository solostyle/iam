			<p>Emotional Diagrams</p><p>Yes, that's the current working term for what I'm sort of trying to do. On July 12 I wrote an email to my friend Gary describing all the things I want to cleanse my system of. He hasn't replied since he's off roaming the world, but I took some time today to get a clearer picture of everything I wrote about. I made a diagram and connected pieces of psyche with arrows and boxes.</p><p>The diagram is a very objective way of looking at things. So many of the issues are interconnected in complex ways. So complex that it's kind of hard to visualize a system that makes it work. What's behind all this? Is it a decentralized system? I did find one particular issue that wasn't one of the "main" ones at first, but when I was done making the diagram, all the "main" issues pointed to it.</p><p>I did a little more poking around and just figured out what makes this ED work. I make each issue that I perceive as an issue into a little entity. Then I ask "why?" and "what is this made of?" Those questions are different, but the answers ended up being the same. Then I make each answer into its own entity. And I try to connect the entities with directional arrows that signify what is composed of or caused by what.</p><p>I kind of like doing this. I think I could do this for myself and for other people. Like maybe in some alternate universe I could be really good at helping people organize their psyches to figure out what one thing would be best to focus on. Why not? I spend hours doing it for myself anyway.</p>
