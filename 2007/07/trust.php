			<h2>Trust</h2>

			<p>Dr. Bloome cares enough to call me about a misunderstanding I had. I thought the sesamoidectomy would be quick and require only local anesthesia. I must have misheard him, but after he called (persistently until I answered) we cleared it up. He even said he feels our relationship is very important and our feelings about each other and about this procedure are important for things to go well during recovery. Good doctor.</p><p>Phew. I'm glad I chose to have it done here and now with Dr. Bloome instead of there and in several months by an unknown surgeon. Thanks to the people who helped me think it through.</p><p>Though I only sketch every once in a while, and draw proper even less frequently, I have this feeling that I will never unlearn how to draw. When I look at something, and especially if I know what it is, I can draw it. I used to have the hardest time with feet and toes in different positions. But lately, I've gotten the hang of it. I have to turn difficult forms into 2D to get them to look 3D. I go between 2- and 3D until I understand it.</p><p>I started a new oil piece. It is drying. I won't be able to work on it again until Sunday morning. This is the first oil piece (using water mixable oil) that I've gotten myself to commit to completing. Well.. it's the first "important" oil that I'm going to complete. It took this long. I am quieting the bifurcating mind and shutting up my feelings until this is done.</p><p>While it dries I'm starting a watercolor representation of a physical form. I just really want to explore the shadows of the toes. I doubt it has anything to do with my foot problems, or knee/leg problems. I had a conte piece a long time ago that looks exactly like the pose I'm painting now. I love this pose. It reminds me of waiting. It reminds me of inertia. I want to capture the heaviness of the feet and the innocence of those girlish legs and bony knees. I want to capture both immobility and potential.</p><p>It has been a very long time since my last large watercolor.</p><p>I love to sing. I love to release a vibration through my body, through the whole body but out of the throat. I love the feeling of my whole body vibrating sympathetically with the sound. I love the way the sound that I hear makes me feel. I don't necessarily make sounds that make me feel good. I love the way any sound I make feels in my body.</p><p>I don't like to think when I sing. I don't like to learn to sing most particular songs. If I do like to learn to sing a particular song, I like to learn it until I don't think about any of it anymore. Then I can enjoy just making sound. </p><p>I am sad that I may not be able to take my drums to the apartment with me. I am sad sad sad sad sad.</p><p>I will take them anyway.</p><p>There is an element of trust in all of this. Trusting Dr. Bloome is not blind. I can see that he cares, that he knows me. I trust my heart and eyes and hands when I look to see. That trust is nothing special. It is as basic to all of us as blinking (except for that poor boy from Iraq, I think, who got burned so badly when he was two that he couldn't close his eyes until he came to the US to get treated years later). So maybe it is special. I want to create, so I'm starting something, anything. It doesn't matter. I just have to trust that I can complete it even if it is meaningless. Or I have to realize nothing is that meaningful anyway. I trust that one day I will have a song that I like to sing. Maybe I will hear it, maybe in a dream, maybe awake, but if I don't keep my voice sharp (or flat? or natural?) maybe I will never know. The drums thing is sad. But I will practice with practice pads if nothing else. I trust that one day I will be as good as I always wanted to be.</p><p>When you slow down, time is really on your side. I take a deep breath... And I see that I am not leaving my friends behind. Slowing down helps me trust. The world can whirl by, but I'm still here, just breathing.</p>
