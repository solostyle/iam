			<h2>Shaving</h2>
			<h3>10 November 2007  @ 20:05</h3>
			<p>I shaved my upper lip with a straight razor. It burned a little afterwards but that's to be expected for the first time. No cuts. I look more effeminate. The skin feels different from after threading. There are little stubbles right now that I can feel, but after threading I usually feel nothing. Just skin. </p>
