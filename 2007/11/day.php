			<h2>Day</h2>
			<h3>12 November 2007  @ 16:26</h3>
			<p>Okay. Today is beautiful. The time of year that I love most in Houston. Cottony air, slightly damp. Misty sunlight, white through puffy afternoon clouds. </p><p>I think tonight I will start posting some recipes that I really like. The rule is that I have to have made it before, or I have to make it soon. For example, I've made cake, pudding, stews, soups, vegetable dishes, and breads, but I haven't yet made my mom's kootu or soap. I have the recipes for both of them, and I even have the ingredients. So I can probably safely say that I will make them soon. Ideally it would be nice to make it searchable, i.e. let the robots index the files for others to read. I do enjoy this blog being entirely unsearchable, unliked to anything else.</p>
