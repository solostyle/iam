			<h2>No Midol</h2>
			<h3>02 November 2007  @ 13:47</h3>
			<p>Today is the first day of my period this cycle. The past 4 times, this has been the most difficult day, and I had to take a full dose of Midol every time. So far today has not warranted that measure. I wrote back to Kouichi-san this early afternoon. That was pleasant. I would like to improve my grammar, using more advanced expressions. This morning Dr. Garcia found some muscles in my left butt that might be causing a leg-length difference. I have a suspicion that I was born with one leg slightly longer than the other. I did some abdominal exercises last night. And pushups. I hope everything goes well. I'm becoming increasingly more prudent about treating myself right and listening to myself more. I don't go after what I love as much anymore. If I can't do something, I wait and try not to stress out. For example, I haven't really exercised in a long time, and I don't mind. I'm more concerned about my muscles and bones being in the right place, and with eliminating and dissolving existing scar tissue. I'm also concerned with feeling physically okay. I guess that's just the direction I'm slowly starting to take. Sometimes I frighten myself with how careful and fastidious about my health I've become. The cramps are encroaching. I struggle with the approach of death -- allowing it to happen versus fending it off with every gesture. Little things... like whether or not to get up again to brush my teeth before bed after I've already lain down. Sitting up straight all the time versus noticing my slouch and succumbing to it. The worst is stressing out about love and help from my closest friend -- because I fail to see how unproductive that is. So will I ever stop that? I hope I am getting better at it. Before, I had little confidence that I was improving, but today, after noticing that I have become more internally focused (that something has changed), I feel that maybe I am improving.</p>
