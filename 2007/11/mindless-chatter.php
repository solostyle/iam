			<h2>Mindless chatter</h2>
			<h3>03 November 2007  @ 17:02</h3>
			<p>I have been feeling very frightened lately. I am afraid of going out alone. Be it by car, by bike, or on foot. It was a big accomplishment going out there last night to paint the pole. It didn't take long, ok, but there were some people hanging around out and about. Friday night loitering I guess. What's so scary about going out? Well, unfortunately, I have started to let this bother me, and I never thought it would, but I am a woman. I am also not a terribly ugly one, at that. Second, also something I never wanted to affect me, I think after the accident I just feel less safe overall, like everything and everyone is out to get me, like the world is this cruel, unyielding place full of horrors that only big burly strong MEN can handle. Or, alternatively to MEN, a world that only people in big, muscular CARS that deal with, and survive in. Yes, survival. I now that sounds--is-- so cliche, and so predictable that I would feel this way after what I've been through. I remember a few alarming times in my 426 apartment when I couldn't even bing myself to get out of the house. It wasn't that I was afraid to ride my bike, it was that I couldn't bring myself to face the world--OUT THERE. I even feel ill-equipped to handle the world. What a strange feeling. And that feeling is still there. Fuck me, if it is cliche. Oh no, whatever will I do, now that I make sense? Of course, more than ever I want to run away to an imaginary world where there are no cars or mean people, or suching and impatience, or pressure to be liked, or struggle to find and hold a good job. Where there is no unclean air or water, where the soil is always nutritious, and where animals do not get driven out of their habitats by humans in their big, muscular CARS, lost in their big, faceless hotels, unaware of their dying gut microbes. That imaginary world is defined only by what of this world it lacks. Last night I dreamed of blowing up the entire world. I think I've developed an intense hatred for many different types of people. I can't believe it. I have never cared much for anyone else. But I guess once you interface with them, this kind of thing is bound to happen. I can make a monster out of you, make you forget what you wanted to do, what you love, make you forget why you ever watned it at all. I want to hide away from the world at least for a while, and feel safe, and never come out, and not have to hear anyone around me, either. So I can see myself becoming used to the idea of living with someone and being taken care of. Or at least having the outside worldtaken care of. I wait for someone to come home and pull me out of bed and out doing useful things. It sounds like, taken too far, it could be dangerous, but considering that I used to be quite the opposite, I'm sure this will pass. Also, IF this agoraphobia is bound to happen, then the only way out of it, and back to independence would be to allow for some rest before going back to center. Center: where it's neither too overly independent nor too frightened and agoraphobic. But I am really not ready for that yet. Besides, I think I really want to rest forevfer and ever, for a very long time,away from everyone, by myself in the middle of that imaginary world. Maybe this is the closest thing to that: sitting here in Nick's apartment, waiting for him to come in two days, and meanwhile, typing away on his typewriter. It helps that I'm on my period, since that keeps me inside out of sheer disgust at the world. Luckily at least I am not in excruciating abdominal pain, although honestly I don't think that would ruin much. I am only just sitting around anyway. It isn't like I'm really doing anything important that requires me to completely ignore my bodily processes. Like, for instance, being at work, or taking care of children, or the elderly, or cooking, or consoling a troubled friend. I've now been just babbling to myself for the past four or so hours. I am addicted to typing today because I have no other way of dealing with this obsessive paranoia. I think paranoia is what it really is. I guess I could occupy myself with anything self-absorbed, typing being just one of those things. I could spend the whole day studying Japanese or Microbiology. Yes, both of those options sound appealing. Good, reliable ways to get out of my head. Ways to forget about the world outside. I feel like the only memories I have today are those of people attacking or hurting me, just to get their way, or to self-righteously teach me a "lesson" or something. I don't want even to talk to anyone, unless it is to people like Eli, Randy, Jordan, Kelly, Derek, or Roopa. Yesterday i did a bunch of pushups, including triangle and arms-really-wide-apart pushups. I also ate a whole bar of organic chocolate while driving home about 6 miles in horrendous traffic, which took an hour! My car is running on half-biodiesel/half-diesel right now. The next time I fill up, I am going to use full 100% Biodiesel, baby! I still really want to get an electric motorcycle, car, or scooter. But I can only really (reasonably) afford a scooter, which I don't think is particulaly safe, especially in the winter. I could ask my dad to help me purchase a Toyota Corolla, OR I COULD just get the scooter for less money. And keep more money. Also I need to figure out just how I am going to drive all my stuff up there in the middle of December. I have someone to help me, dear sweet Nicholas, but what about the cost and am I going to have to rent a hitched car with a trailer? Or will I simply be able to afford the one-way rental of a big moving van? I don't have THAT much stuff, but I don't know exactly what I will be able to take. Okay, so I won't be able to take the drums, not until I can buy land, or a house, or live with a bunch of people who also play music and don't mind the noise, or until I can afford a soundproof room. I should be able to afford the one-way rental. Whatever. When I lived in Evanston all that time sans voiture, je n'avais pas eu besoin d'une voiture. Plusieurs fois, j'ai seulement fait une promenade pour retourner a ma chambre. La neige n'avais jamais etee une probleme grave. In Elmhurst, if I live more than a mile away from work, it might be hard to walk to work every morning, but Jordan lives in Portland and does it every morning. Yes, he has lived there through at least one whole winter. I feel like I need another adjustment soon but I will try to be a good little girl and not self-adjust, and wait until Tuesday, my next appointment. I wonder if typewriting people in the sixties and so on had really strong pinkies. My pinky fingers seem to be really poor at mashing down on their designated keys. These days keyboards, on computers, are all soft-touch, and silent, and meant for really super fast, effortless typing. No question. But that's cool. If things had never changed, I wouldn't be so enjoying this now, would I?</p>
