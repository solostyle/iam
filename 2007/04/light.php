			<h2>Light</h2>
			<h3>01 April 2007  @ 11:55</h3>
			<p>Moving into the light.. right. That's what I thought this new phase would be. I'm so naive. It isn't happening in phases. This morning I realized the things that I can't accept about myself originate somewhere in the things that I can accept. I have often needed someone to help me through something, and that's okay. As long as it isn't an unhealthy attachment. What makes it healthy has a little to do with me and a little to do with the other person. I've also often felt that I am alone and everyone is at a comfortable distance from me. I think I rather like it that way, now that I see what being close to someone can be. I guess it just doesn't work for me. I'm thankful that I was given the opportunity to discover this in a helpful environment. I could imagine it being a lot worse--if the person I was close to was needy or possessive or controlling. </p><p>But then again, I'm not sure it's so defined. For instance, I tend only to remember the good about the past when it might have actually been worse. People tend to remember the good about the past when they long for it due to some present lack. They also tend to remember the good about the past when they feel that they're getting better and much further along now. Basically, I'm saying that maybe this present moment, even though it feels like it came out of a horribly difficult recent past, might actually be good. And I might remember it later as good. I might even remember the horribly difficult recent past as good.</p><p>Not to intellectualize it too much, but that's what I'm good at. In any case, I've been okay, I guess. I'm not really that into any image-making process of art. I like the process rather than the image. I think I might have liked images before, or something, but I feel less and less moved by images in general, even anything I see. I like feeling things, like music and vibrations, rhythm, heat, cold, tiredness, joy, muscle aches, fear, calm.. etc. Not so much joy, I guess. I don't like feeling joy, but I don't mind noticing it. Same with fear. The extremes are too dramatic.</p><p>Today there was an earthworm lying on the path near the backyard lawn. It was still moving. I inspected it to make sure it wasn't crushed or mangled, but it was all twisted over itself, which didn't look comfortable. Anyway, I got a stick and picked it up and put it on the grass. It didn't seem to like that much, so I moved it over to the flowerbed and made a little depression in the dirt. It eventually slithered into it, and then I covered its exposed skin with more dirt. I don't know if this is true, but for some reason, I feel like UV light is probably bad for it. It's meant to be under the ground, so being exposed to so much light must be harsh.</p><p>Even though I still fear touching little critters, I feel compassionate toward them. My Buddhist Psych prof told me a story about catching a fluttering moth at a meditation retreat and cupping it in her hands, thinking, "It's just a little thing fluttering around in my hands.. that's not so bad." It was the first move of bravery she ever made toward getting over her fear of critters. Then she released it outside. Now that she has a kid, she wants to raise him well, including showing him no fear toward any living creature. So even though she fears them, she pretends not to, just for her son, and, she says, it sort of works. She's started to actually stop fearing them just by pretending.</p>
