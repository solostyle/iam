			<h2>Choi's voiz</h2>
			<h3>04 April 2007  @ 19:16</h3>
			<p>... came out of its sheath of memory and made an appearance today. Vanessa, the physical therapist taking care of my sesamoiditis a few times a week, massaged the swollen bead under the offending sesamoid today with so much force that I couldn't help hearing Master Choi. His voice repeated, "This is your body. Don't be afraid of your body." </p><p>I have to admit. I came in with such a sour face and such a pissy attitude that it didn't surprise me that I got such negative reactions from everyone around me. Although it did further irk me. Which I guess is just what I wanted. Ah, downward spirals.</p><p>The fact is, I hate going to that damn office because they never call me in on time. I have an appointment at ten, they call me in at ten-thirty. Why the hell do I even bother to schedule anything? I canceled two physical therapies before even turning up, with some excuse that the time didn't work for me, when actually I just didn't want to wait.</p><p>But I showed up two days ago, Monday, and today, too, because, after all, what else can I do about this foot? But after what I learned today, I'm actually excited about showing up tomorrow. I think I'm a pretty tough cookie to please, so my approval has to mean something.</p><p>I trudged in without a smile, soaked my feet in the warm jetting water tub, did some foot exercises (moving marbles with my toes, clamping down with my toes on a spring), and then got ready for electro-stim. At this point I finally burst out and complained to Vanessa that she was completely insensitive that she never even talked to me, failed to ask anything about the surgery I just had yesterday, and some other groundless rants that I can't remember now.</p><p>Funny.. I can't believe I had the nerve to do such a thing. I never yell at someone I don't even know. I never really talked to her before and we don't know much about each other. That's something else that bothered me--that she didn't know shit about my past, about what brought me here in the first place, about why I can't wear that boot that she insists I wear (it throws my still-healing hips off wack). Nevertheless, I felt astoundingly better after letting that out. My only regret is that it was directed at her, when really I should have directed it at no one and just asked for an ear. </p><p>After this debacle, Dr. Vargas came in for a bit and asked me how I was doing. He told me about some other possibilities we can try, like a Depo-Medrol injection (which he told me to look up after I brushed it off with a remark about cortisone being bad for the hippocampus). He also heard my wails about having to travel these days for interviews and surgeries, and then he suggested a device that involves taping the toe so that it doesn't move when I walk. Yay! I had been thinking all this time about getting a kind of splint that would immobilize just the toe (not the whole damn foot). He also told me that many athletes who get this injury have to retire (!!) and/or spend entire days in therapy.</p><p>Quite eye-opening, I must say. Even though it seems so minor, sesamoiditis is actually very painful, very slow-healing, a nuisance like few others--and I need to take it more seriously. I must do more than complain about it to friends and lament that I can't do this or that. I have to be involved in its healing. I must not be afraid to touch myself where it hurts, to accept this and pay it some attention.</p>
