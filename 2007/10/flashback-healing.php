			<p>I wonder.. to get over something painful, do you have to reexperience it and completely process it? For instance, since I went completely numb at the moment of the accident, and for a few hours after it, does that mean I have to feel full 100% non-numbed pain of the same degree as the accident, all the pain that I missed while my body decided to knock itself out, before I can get over the experience?</p><p>And would that mean then that I have a long way still ahead of me while I attempt to realign my body (with Chiropractic and martial arts and Chi Kung) that would include all the pain I missed?</p><p>Or maybe it doesn't work that way?</p><p>But it does make sense that to truly get through and beyond something, you have to see it with open eyes.. and maybe that means evoking the same experiences.</p>
