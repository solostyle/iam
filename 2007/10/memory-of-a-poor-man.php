			<h2>Memory of a poor man</h2>
			<h3>31 October 2007  @ 23:33</h3>
			<p>Nick treated me to a sundae. I had been clamoring for one for a few weeks. In the end, of course, it was more disappointing than satisfying. I knew that would happen, but I think it was just the principle of having a sundae that drove me on. I tried to eat it all without even thinking about it. It was an exercise in conscious mindlessness--another form of mindfulness, I would say. Perhaps now the memory of the sundae experience will leave me at peace with the confidence that I don't really want a sundae.</p><p>Last night Nick found a bunch of his old letters. I read through many of the ones I had written him. I'm incredibly curious about what and How I wrote back then (not very long ago), since that was how we got to know each other.</p><p>(What is truth? Is it in telling the bare minimum that you are sure is NOT false? Or is it in telling everything that you think might be true, even if it contradicts? If it's the latter, I would say maybe it was how we started to love each other, too.</p><p>(But what is love anyway? Confusing! If the present love didn't exist (and does it really exist anyway?) then would the letter-writing have just been close counsel and friendship? Am I rewriting the past in terms of the present? Maybe that's still what it is now. Who knows. On Monday someone asked me if I was Nick's girlfriend. I should have just said yeah, but instead I had to turn it into a long confusing explanation that only embarrassed both of us. I wish people could somehow not think that question, or completely refrain from noticing anything. I can sense the 'intimate relationship' concept starting to change our relationship. He calls me endearing epithets, which is cool, but certainly different from what he used to call me (my name). Hmm.. I'm trying to think of more examples of ways perception has affected reality, but nothing seems potent enough.</p><p>Maybe the subtlety makes it hard to pin down.</p><p>But the inward perception is far more intriguing to me. There are so many interweaving, askew, parallel, and intersecting components to the letters and the relationship. I feel mildly capable of tackling it tonight. After all, I'm sitting alone in his apartment. He's away for five days on a trip somewhere. My letters are near me. His books are around me. This things. Some of mine, too. There's an interesting mix. I'm in a strange place. (How many different places can possibly feel like home? None of them ever feel like home. I've moved so frequently that only one place has ever felt like home. and it no longer is. The memory is heart-breaking at times.. I wish I could go back there today and feel complete. I guess I just have to be content with feeling strange.)</p><p>So let's see.. from what I remember, when I first saw him randomly, I felt a strange jolt in my gut. I wrote about it that night in my diary, so I still have the account of that. I don't know how I ever knew anything about him, though, because, strangely, when Rocky would tell me about him I felt that it was all wrong. The way she described him seemed unholy, sacrilegious. I felt something else. We shared books about Buddhism, he introduced me to Thich Nhat Hanh, and I would steal books from Barnes and Noble, leave them in my hoodie, and my mom would wash it accidentally, and I would end up with an even more endearing Buddha Reader.</p><p>I got Rocky's AIM and somehow Nick's, too. She was way less interesting to chat with, and I felt strangely like I was only talking to her because of her connection to Nick. I wish I had kept our conversations, but from what I remember (and memory is unreliable), they were insightful, intelligent, introspective, investigative, and therapeutic. And mutual. We had a great balance. He'd sometimes tell me about something he was thinking about that I would question, driving him to a different conclusion. And I would sometimes confide something in him.. I think it was mostly about life and people and personalities and principles an ideals. Advice. That kind of thing. But I remember he would ask probing questions, which I can't remember from anyone else at the time. Except my good online friends, like Jordan.</p><p>Okay also strangely (because this hasn't changed much) back then I felt a mystical unexplainable connection to him. In my high school going away party book he wrote, ".. and I know we will meet again." It was probably an unconscious, yearbooky type thing to say, but still stuck in my mind. Perhaps because I wished it were true.</p><p>Who is this dude, anyway? I can't believe we're really here. Am I even conscious? Memories make everything feel so unreal.</p><p>I think back in high school we would also share music. I remember bringing my CD's to school everyday, of course, to help with the loneliness of lunch and class, and I would get him to hear some Ruins or whatever. The music connection is still there. I wasn't aware of the art connection at that time, but now I realize we'd both been connected in that way, too.</p><p>I think he's happy that I've started painting and doing art again because it might have been one of the first things he remembers about me. I'm really glad that is an early memory, not only because it is an early memory for me too, about myself, but also because the more that memory is reinforced by myself and people close to me, the more likely I will be to continue to keep creativity running through my life. I may not have a constant home or occupation, but at least I can have something. Perception is good for something.</p><p>And maybe the enduring aspects of my perception will help him, too.</p><p>A myriad perceptions are all wrapped up in this thing. I've had a growing, changing concept of friendship for all these years beginning in grade school. My conviction grew during high school.. and I couldn't, wouldn't settle for anything else. I think that perception has been the most influential force in my life. My sister told me recently that people don't have to share the same opinions to be friends. I understand how that can be true, but my belief in relating in ways unrestricted by labels and popular concepts is either too tenuous or too strong to allow for people who don't agree with me. So I've been trying to find avenues that will accept this belief, and the most accepting avenue so far has been Nick. I should be glad, or should have been glad while it has been developing, but actually when something is that close to you it is frightening. Most of the time I struggled with control and letting go, partly because I wanted to see where it could go naturally (which answers the question of how much do our fundamentals agree) and partly because I was afraid it would go terribly awry and become the mediocrity that results from falling into popular concepts.</p><p>A lot of times I think I would freak out because my worst fear was this.. falling into mediocrity. And sometimes the only way I could release the fear was by playing it out and seeing where it went, even if it wasn't really happening. Surprisingly I found Nick's awesomeness went so far that he didn't simply react to me based on me playing out a fear, but he also didn't disregard or belittle my fear-performance. Most of the time, when you see someone freak out and become irrational, you would want to label them as freaks and go the opposite way--either ignore them or lash out and deliberately do things that would play into their fears. But he doesn't react that way, and he doesn't just ignore it and hope I'll go back to normal. I think that's the way I would want to react to someone in my situation, too. Not only is the fear-performance a test of whether our fundamentals agree, but even the reaction to the fear is a similar kind of meta-test. I hate that I test in this way pre-consciously. (It is not unconscious, it is pre-conscious.) But hopefully I won't have to do that silliness anymore. I am belittling it all now, myself, because I do think it is silly, but only now because I have found the answers.</p><p>I'll continue this later.</p>
