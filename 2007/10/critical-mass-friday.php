			<h2>Critical Mass Friday</h2>
			<h3>27 October 2007  @ 20:11</h3>
			<p>I'm listening to the score of Alexander Nevsky by Prokofiev on a vinyl that Nick bought recently. We picked out this one, Mendelssohn, and Tchaikovsky. Good eastern European and Russian composers. We saw a collection of Franz Lizst's Hungarian Rhapsodies, which I love, but it would have gotten to pricey, and anyway it was only one of a 3-volume set. Alexander Nevsky has dramatic operatic singing. I'm not sure what I think of that yet.</p><p>So much excitement yesterday! It was our first Critical Mass together, Nick and I, and Nick's first one ever. I have done a few in Chicago, but never in Houston. At Tranquility park I counted roughly 67 people. People might have left or more might have joined after the ride began. We rode up to Washington Street, and when we hit Shepherd, Sebastian, Cheyanne, Nick, Jared, and I split off to attend a Monster Show (exhibit of monster-themed art work) at Domy Books. </p><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/b/monster1.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/s/monster1_small.jpg" /></a> <a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/b/monster2.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/s/monster2_small.jpg" /></a><br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/b/monster3.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/s/monster3_small.jpg" /></a></p><p>Sebastian had 4 pencil drawings, one of which sold (for $57!) That was pretty cool.</p><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/b/seb1.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/s/seb1_small.jpg" /></a> <a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/b/seb2.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/s/seb2_small.jpg" /></a><br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/b/seb3.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/s/seb3_small.jpg" /></a> <a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/b/seb4.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/s/seb4_small.jpg" /></a></p><p>We met up with Jared's friend Marie and the six of us ate at Empire across the street. Nick got two chocolate cookies for the price of one (they like him!) and I enjoyed munching that with many a "Hawm!" and many a "Hrrum!" S, C, N, and I rode back home after that, but we stopped for a little while at the Maxwell House Coffee factory to take pictures. </p><p>Sebastian told us an inventive story about a colony of mutants that inhabit the environs surrounding the factory, claiming it was a rough neighborhood for that reason. So I egged him on with the story.. Apparently they only detect moving objects, but they also have a blind spot for things between 5 and 12 miles per hour. That was why we were safe (we were riding pretty slowly). </p><p>Just then a big dog jumped out of the darkness and barked toward us. I screamed and immediately felt silly and exclaimed, "it's a mutant!" Sebastian said, "see?" The dog left us alone once we were out of his territory. </p><p>[show pictures of the factory]</p><p>Then Nick tried to go up to the security guard at the entrance, but the guard simply gave him the cold shoulder. He wanted to ask if they held tours, but on bicycle, dressed like a punk, at midnight.. these were among factors not in his favor. So off we returned to the mutant-infested path home.</p>
