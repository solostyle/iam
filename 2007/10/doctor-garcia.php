			<h2>Doctor Garcia</h2>
			<h3>22 October 2007  @ 22:19</h3>
			<p>This morning Nick and I went to see Dr Jefrey (sp?) Garcia, Chiropractor. The power had just gone out in his office's complex and so we had a partially in-the-dark first session. I went first and explained to him the accident and problems that I've had and been having, but basically he found out more by touching me. I find that always works better for me. And I <em>love</em> being touched, especially by people who know what they're doing. So far in my life, those people have included Nick, Dr Olson (Naprapath), Christie and Jackie (Physical Therapists), the masseuse at Northwestern's SPAC, Master Choi (Acupuncture, Tai Chi). And I hope to add more to the list, especially since I don't see most of those people anymore.</p><p>He fixed my lower back and neck, the two areas that cause me much suffering right now. The lower back he chose to adjust first, stretching my hip flexors and identifying weak muscles (Iliacus and psoas, which are generally lumped together as one muscle these days. <a href="http://www.oralchelation.com/calcium/DegenerativeHipJoint/p7.htm">more info</a>). I felt a tingling in my lower back later that day at lunch and during the drive home. Those muscles are used for sitting, apparently, which explains why I was in so much pain in the hospital. I couldn't bear moving or even resting supinely because there was always pressure on the pelvic fractures and those muscles were continually strained.</p><p>He also worked on the neck, which he identified as having two opposite rotations. The C2 and C3 vertebrae are rotated to my right and forward, but the C1 is rotated left and forward. His goal is to bring all of them back to center, of course, but given my history of hypermobility and flexibility, it will be a wonder if any adjustment sticks. In any case, the adjustment he made today was blinding, literally. I couldn't see straight for a while, it felt like I had a headache or a head rush. A lot of energy and nerve stimulation up there. Later on throughout the day I felt a lot of tingling radiating from behind the head and into the sides of my jaw, where the fractures had been. I think this is positive and healthy because all the surgery and dental work since the accident has weakened those nerves and the bones are still weak, too. Stimulating the nerves around the area probably means more blood flow and healing.</p><p>I tend to be more flexible than strong, so I need to remember to stop stretching so much and packing more strength-training into my days.</p><p>Immediately after the adjustments I felt hungry. I had been worried during the drive over that I would get hungry and I forgot to bring a snack with me. But after the adjustment, instead of worrying that I would get hungry (but not actually feeling any desire to eat) I actually felt hunger. And ravenous hunger, at that. We stopped off at Nit Noi in the area, which is a great restaurant--excellent food, unique Thai with actual variety you don't find at cheaper Thai restaurants. </p><p>So finally I felt hungry, I enjoyed eating, I felt full, and later I didn't feel sick. For the past week I just haven't wanted to eat anything in particular, or rather, I haven't wanted to eat everything in particular. Mention any food to me, and I would have been disgusted. And I would mope around thinking about food and what to eat, not even feeling hungry, so wondering why I was even thinking about food, and decide that I hated everything, and get down on myself about life, finding no pleasure in anything, as if hating food signified having no desires. </p><p>Desire is a powerful thing. Remember yesterday I couldn't even feel happy that Nick was home? Well today I was happy he was home because I was happy with myself. Or at least happier. When I don't feel desire, I wonder why I am alive. Desire is powerful. Think of the babies who are deprived of touch and love and so die because they see no reason to continue living. Touch and love arouse desire, hopefully mutual desire (which is best), and you need that to live. Unfortunately, mad proponents of anhedonia somehow manage to hog the spotlight and ruin pleasure and desire--and therefore life--for many people. That would include most practicing Hindus (which I know from experience), many Christians, and  probably others who get a kink out of repression. Funny how religion is always the first institution to deny the basics of life. Isn't religion supposed to be based in philosophy, which would then imply that it seeks to align itself with life's realities?</p><p>Back on track... I caught myself trying to pop my neck this afternoon. It was so cool to catch myself doing it! It's completely unconscious. All of a sudden something clicks in my brain, "Oh, my neck needs popping! Pronto!" And then I proceed to make crazy movements with my head while tensing my muscles so as to simulate what my Naprapath would have done. But today I caught myself in mid head-swing, a practice that struck me as completely bizarre and BAD for my spine. Good! That is good negative reinforcement and hopefully I will stop!</p><p>Also I have a strange and extremely sensitive callus or fluid sac <em>just</em> under the skin over my 12th thoracic vertebra. Poopie. I have no idea why it formed today, but I hope to remember to tell Dr Garcia.</p><p>Finally I also want to mention that I think I'll be able to sleep better after this adjustment. Nick and I took an afternoon nap after we came home, and I slept the way I used to sleep when I was a kid. That mellow, warm submerged feeling of being smothered by sleep to the point of paralysis.</p><p>Also I have to ice my back and neck every night. I should probably do my right knee while I'm at it.</p>
