			<h2>Power of Man's Red Flower</h2>
			<h3>21 October 2007  @ 11:50</h3>
			<p>Last night Nick had a dream and in this dream he had an interesting idea for an art project. There were bungee cords hanging from the ceiling from which people could swing and bounce around. I like the idea. I had an idea to show a bunch of work and give everyone an eraser and have them all erase the work. I assumed it would all be pencil or chalk pieces, but the same would go for paintings. I would provide gesso and brushes and sandpaper and solvents. </p><p>I'm really upset that some people keyed my car really badly. The passenger side and the hood of the car have scratches several feet long, and most of them go down to the metal. I don't know what to do about it. I got on the freeway this morning and deliberately went slower than other people just to piss them off. Several people honked and tried to pass me. I wasn't going too slow, I was just going 5 miles under the speed limit, which I sometimes prefer anyway. I refuse to let anyone make me feel like I should drive faster than I want to. Ever.</p><p>I was so mad about it last night when I saw the scratches that I couldn't even feel good about seeing Nick come home. I didn't feel like kissing him or touching him. I just felt like curling into a ball or killing someone. I think I'll put on a Beethoven vinyl. Hmm.. no actually I think I will listen to the Jungle Book soundtrack.</p><p>Well, it's Sunday. Oh, Sundays..</p>
