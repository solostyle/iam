			<h2>Bummed out</h2>
			<h3>26 February 2007  @ 19:46</h3>
			<p>All right, I haven't updated because I haven't been the sparkly star as which I like to project myself. I have been stressed out about family issues and the like. It is making it hard to breathe normally, like there is a constant weight on my mind.</p><p>I have been reading several hours a day, and several books, about meditation, nutrition, and the effect of stress and nutrition on DNA. The information is vast, but I am able to remember things because they matter so much to me. I wonder how much damage has been done already simply stressing out so much these days.</p><p>It just gets worse and worse. It used to be that I could stop dwelling and go to sleep. Today I couldn't concentrate on anything, couldn't take my mind off things. I tried to take a nap because it was so exhausting, hoping that somehow the healing power of sleep would reverse the damage of stress. But I actually woke up with a jarring start because something snapped in my mind. Then the racing heart, the sweating, the dizziness all began again.</p><p>Even though I meditate more now than before, it's as if the progression of stress is far greater than any meditative progress. I'm even considering taking some psychedelic drugs to at least put my brain in a different state, to be away from pain, even if only temporarily. </p><p>I can see how people get addicted to drugs.. It's probably people like me.</p>
