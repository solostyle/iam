			<h2>Interviews</h2>
			<h3>01 February 2007  @ 12:47</h3>
			<p>I have two phone interviews today. I've spent several hours preparing for them. As I prepare, I become aware of multiple identities. I think this could be a real problem if I don't know how to manage them. I have to make sure that everyone is happy, and that's hard when all those people are inside you and fighting each other.</p><p>After these interviews, I want to forget about everything and do the same kind of preparation again--but for an interview with myself. What are the strengths that will carry me through difficult situations in my life? What exactly have I done in my life to prove certain qualities about me that might be more or less constant? What changes? Who are all these people inside me? What does each of them want? What is their relationship to this outside world that I loathe so much? Where can I laugh maniacally about the ridiculousness of it all? And who is laughing, all of them, or just a few?</p><p>I hate thinking. Time to art.</p>
