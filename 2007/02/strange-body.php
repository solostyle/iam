			<h2>Strange Body</h2>
			<h3>01 February 2007  @ 12:32</h3>
			<p>First things first: Owie! My shin hurts. Sadness. Soreness. Pain. But the rest of me feels terrific!</p><p>However, it doesn't look that terrific. I'm eyeing my legs right now, and something seems terribly odd about them. Why are they so huge? Is it just in my head? Are they swollen?</p><p>This morning during my shower, as I was rubbing my shoulders with my hands, they felt very strange. They didn't at all belong to me. They filled my palms differently. Fuller. Harder.</p><p>My back looks terribly alien to me. It's bigger--fatter, even. I don't think it's actually fat, but that's the overall effect of the appearance.</p><p>Hmm... I'm not sure I want to look like this, but does it matter? I will always be baffled by my body when I observe it, as I always have been. These changes are just so different that I'm a bit bewildered. Am I eating too much? Am I eating right? Should this be happening? Do I rest enough? All I have for guidance is what I read and how I interpret myself.</p><p>So I question my choices often, but I don't question the way I exercise. I think I have to keep doing what I'm doing for a long time to allow my body to stabilize.</p><p>Only one more day of super-setting. Following that, one full week of endurance training! Hopefully the leg will stop hurting.</p>
