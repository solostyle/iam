			<h2>Drumming!</h2>
			<h3>05 February 2007  @ 18:28</h3>
			<p>Two days ago I played my drumset for six hours, with no break during the last five. Then today I played for about four hours. If I can only practice 35 hours a week (5 hours a day), then by the end of this month, I will have practiced 140 hours. That's 875 hours by the end of July.  That's about two years' worth of practice! I wish I could do the same with every other interest in my life. How can you ever become an expert in anything if you have to work 40-50 hours a week at a job?</p><p>I don't even want to think about it.</p>
