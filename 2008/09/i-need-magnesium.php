			<p>Eesh. Everything feels like it's going too slow. I feel like my brain is going too fast!</p><p>I jogged and/or ran to the gym, lifted weights, and walked and/or lunged back. The weather is kissably sweet. I want to be outside forever and more.</p><p>I keep running into people. It's nice. They all have such smiling lovely faces.</p><p>I'm probably going camping this weekend, yAY!! And this time with a friend! (A friend who ISN'T totally lame, too!) </p><p>Oh, when I went running, I focused as much as I could on running with proper form, getting my right leg to land properly and push off with the big toe. It made my shin hurt on the medial side, right under the knee. I think that's good. It's the area that broke but never really strengthened. I hope the proper running helps! </p><p>There's more I want to share, but first I need to hide this journal from certain people who might still be trying to find out about me.</p>
