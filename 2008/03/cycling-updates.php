			<h2>Cycling Updates</h2>
			<h3>03 March 2008  @ 08:54</h3>
			<p>Starting January 14, each week I averaged around 30-35 miles. I will estimate 30 just to be conservative. It's better to under- than to overestimate. I got a ride from Will one evening and from Josh that morning. I got another ride from Josh one morning and from Susan that evening. I took a cab on the first day of work, and that evening I got a ride from Mamun. I once got a ride from Will one morning and evening. Besides those times, I have biked to and from work every day. </p><p>The weather has been shitty, of course, and it's good to keep a log of my adventures so that I can compare it next winter. This winter got much more snow and ice than usual, with temperatures dropping well below freezing several times. I have suffered a bit of frostnip in my left forefinger that I have to be careful about in the future.</p><p>I have slipped twice and fallen three times. I slipped in the cemetery the first time, the second slip was at the Emroy/North Ave intersection when the car before me slammed on the brakes, and the third time was this morning when I hit a pothole and flew over the bars. </p><p>Today's spill was the most dangerous because I fell into the road where there could have been traffic. Also it was storming, and I couldn't see the road where there might have been holes. The roads were flooded in a few places. I quickly got up and moved to the side, inspected my wheels (they seemed fine), and put things that fell off the rack back on. I feel a bit out of sorts. The left side of my middle back and my left knee both hurt. Right after I got up I noticed a pain in my jaw that I don't feel anymore. Now I'm really looking forward to seeing Dr. Rugg.</p>
