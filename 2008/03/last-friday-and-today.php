			<h2>Last Friday and Today</h2>
			<h3>17 March 2008  @ 14:58</h3>
			<p><span style="font-style:bold">Last Friday</span></p><p>My last visit to Dr. Rugg and Sharon Fontes was a turning point. Up until that visit, we had been working on ankles, back, neck, and feet. These areas started doing a lot better, though the pain is still considerable at times. The last visit, Dr. Rugg wanted to recap on all the things that I've been feeling and where we should go from here. We decided to start working on the pelvis/hips and made quite a bit of headway that day. We still checked everything else, ankles and feet, etc. </p><p><span style="font-style:bold">Today</span></p><p>Today I want to work on feet again, because they are hurting still. Also ankles and lower back. But we definitely need to make some progress on the pelvic imbalances. I worked out really hard this past weekend, with a lot of lunges and hamstring work. I hope it will continue to pay off.</p><p>(Back from the doc)<br />Crazy pain again in the hips during massage. I had to count to remember to breathe. I told Sharon about how painful it was when they moved me around from cot to cot in the hospital. Two to four people would have to lift the sheet under me and quickly move over to the other bed and put me down. I felt like my whole body was ripping apart. I remembered those incidents today because the pain was very similar. Funny how that happens.</p><p>She gave me some exercises to do for my hips and feet. I am to scrunch up a towel under my toes using only my toes. I am to scrunch with each foot 25 times and do three sets. Then I am to lie on my back with one leg pulled to my chest and roll that ankle 25 times clockwise and 25 times counter-clockwise, and then point and flex 25 times. The other leg is to be straight and the foot is to remain pointing to the ceiling, not flopping to the side.</p><p>The hip exercise is to relax the groin muscles. I am to lie on my back with my feet in butterfly position, heels and toes actively pressing into each other. I am to let the knees fall as far as they go naturally without forcing them down. I should stay like that for several minutes, I'll say 10 to 15. At first my lower back will be arched significantly, but as I relax the arch will relax some.</p><p>Dr. Rugg tacked on some more exercises to my list. I should practice balancing on each foot for as long as I can. (Master Choi would make us do 36 slow deep breaths per foot, and that was something I had to work up to.) I should also be sure to walk around barefoot as often as I can (hell yeah, I love it!). He mentioned the towel-scrunching as well, so that gets an extra vote. It must be pretty effective. Also I should use an elastic exercise band and work on strengthening the shin muscles--not the calf muscles. He said those will be strong anyway, so I should pay extra attention to the muscles on the front of the leg. The muscles on the outside of the leg are also critical. The way to get those is to put resistance on the foot so that it wants to turn inward, and then try to pull the foot outward against the resistance.</p><p>This sucks. I kind of don't want to do all this work, but I don't really have a choice. *Sigh* I guess I gotta make a commitment if I want to get better. I'm getting closer and closer to my body and further and further away from everyone else. Who could relate to me except for people who are doing exactly what I do? Hmm.. I'm lucky that some of my friends are into different exercises. I haven't gone off the deep end or anything.</p><p>But it's no wonder that I feel this way. Today Dr. Rugg said my ankles were like those of someone much much older than me. That I was too young to have such old bones. Even if that is true, I wish I hadn't heard it. That is depressing to the point of apathy. So they're old, does that mean I can hurry up and die already? Why should I care anymore? When he adjusted them today, they actually hurt. Usually I don't feel much, maybe just a click here and there. But today not only did every single adjustment make noise--all the adjustments continued to hurt even after they were done! It feels like a train wreck in my ankles. But apparently this is good... I am "responding well." Hah, yeah, and if that is true, then what about the comment on my aged bones? This old lady ... bah, maybe he was just joking. Maybe it's one of those aged things that can grow younger over time.</p><p>Dr. Rugg is still stellar at moving individual bones. Go him! He really got my spine right today. I really hope I am in good hands. I hope I have the willpower to do these exercises everyday. I just know I am going to get tired of it.</p>
