			<h2>Physical Update</h2>
			<h3>03 March 2008  @ 07:27</h3>
			<p>January:</p><p>I exercised little--mostly only by biking to and from work. I averaged 25 miles a week for the last two weeks of January. I stretched, did pushups and pullups, etc. I went to Courts Plus (gym) to get two free passes. I used one and lifted weights and swam that day. </p><p>February:</p><p>Things started to pick up when I started seeing Dr. Donofrio (DC). I joined the gym and started going a few times a week. His adjustments didn't help much. It made my right hip more and more sore, right at the sacroiliac joint. That whole time I thought he was actually helping it, but now I think maybe it was just being aggravated more. I started seeing Dr. Rugg instead and things got better. I only saw him once on Monday the 25th, and was pain-free for five full days. On Friday I began to have low back pain again, and on Saturday or Sunday I started to feel my cervical vertebrae slip out of the right spot. I started working out harder, pulling up my old 3-day-split weight lifting files and following the exercises there. It's been a full year since I started trying to build muscle and eat more protein. I didn't stick with it all last year because of various surgeries and crap, but hopefully I'll be able to stick with it this year.</p><p>Current:<br />I'm seeing Dr. Rugg again today, for the second time. He and Sharon should be able to put me back together. I've been trying to walk from heel to toe again (with the left foot), even if it hurts my toe. I hope the massage helps with the foot. I look forward to the appointment.</p>
