			<h2>Melting Snot</h2>
			<h3>26 February 2008  @ 08:28</h3>
			<p> I didn't sleep well last night. I keep waking up at three or four. I do sleep mostly on my back. After waking up in the middle of the night I tend to want to sleep on my side thereafter. Yesterday's treatment with Dr. Rugg was phenomenal. He not only corrected my cervical vertebrae, but also pinpointed joint problems in my back and ankles. He literally pointed into them and unlocked them, his finger a key. My faith in doctors has dramatically improved, but only in terms of this one guy. The massage therapist, Sharon, released my right hip a bit. I can feel a subtle difference there. I think it might be so tense right now that i can't feel much even when she pushes around. I require deep muscle tissue work. The most amazing thing she did for me is massage my left foot. I think I could cry. There is so much baggage stored in my foot! Fear, sadness, self-pity, guilt, undeservingness. I never wanted it to end. And she did it for a long time, long after I even hoped she would stop. Maybe it was just yesterday that I was so fortunate, but to think I could see these people twice a week every week for only $10 a pop--and potentially receive the same quality of treatment every time, it's almost unthinkable. Time will tell. </p><p>So far I've felt some crazy strange bodily sensations since yesterday. I've been trying all morning to keep my posture straight, relax my neck, shoulders, and eyes, keep my feet flat on the trash can under them (they do not reach the floor), and adjust my work environment to better suit my body. I find it almost difficult to breathe. I keep my chin back to keep my cervical spine in line. I still try to breathe normally--into my lower abdomen--but I sometimes feel like my chest muscles are restrictive. He adjusted my ribs yesterday--even though (he said) most people think it's the middle back, he actually releases the ribs to allow the chest to expand better.. or something.</p><p>I felt that unreal sensation last night. The first time I felt it was after being adjusted by Dr. Garcia. I think he got it the first time, or maybe the second. But Dr. Rugg was able to get it yesterday, the first time. And he was so precise about it. He can move just one bone at a time, though others may move minimally as well, especially if the surrounding muscles are tense. Anyway immediately after the movement, I thought I might feel that unrealness, but I didn't. It took about an hour before I felt it. When I came home I started to feel pain radiating from the base of the skull to the forehead. Overwhelming energy, too, as if the sun was beating its cosmic rays directly into my nervous system. It's the one headache that I actually like. I was sore the rest of the evening, though not as sore as I had been after the first adjustment by Dr. Garcia. That day it was so terrible I had to sleep most of the afternoon. It was like I had biked a century. Yesterday was okay. I might have let myself lie down, but I was hungry and needed to make food for today. Also I was so excited and overjoyed that I couldn't contain myself. I took a warm shower and called my mother. We talked for a long time, and she was happy for me, too. </p><p>My next appointment is next Monday, March 3. </p><p>And then I'm planning to do the Frozen Snot Century. I had been planning for it two years ago, but I got hit by a car right before it. So hopefully I will get to do it this year. *Crossing fingers* Here's the blurb on <a href="http://bikewinter.org/calendar/scheduleofevents.php?city_id=1">bikewinter</a> about it:</p><p><blockquote>Frozen Snot Century: NOTE: THE FSC HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED. CHICAGOANS WILL DEPART ON SATURDAY, MARCH 8. Join us for the 5th annual Frozen Snot Century. Here's the schedule for this year: Sat. March 8: Chicagoans meet at the Hollywood Grill,1601 W. North Ave, 7 am for breakfast, 8 am departure. Ride 95 miles or so to Milwaukee. Crash with Milwaukeeans. Sun. March 9: FIBs and Cheeseheads ride back south together. Wisconsinites sleep on Illinoisan's couches. Mon. March 10: Badgers bike home. A few things to keep in mind: No registration fee but please RSVP to greenfieldjohn@hotmail.com. The route is basically Sheridan rd. in IL and Rte. 32 in WI. Ride at your own pace.</blockquote></p><p>I will bike two centuries that weekend--one up to Milwaukee on Saturday, and one back to Chicago on Sunday. Then Monday, March 10, I see Dr. Rugg and Sharon and they will fix all my broken pieces with magic. Yay.</p>
