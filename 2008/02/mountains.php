			<p>Here I am at work. For reasons unknown I am keenly aware of being alive at this moment. I made a decision last night that may change the course of my life. Yes I see a hope of a future far better than I thought was possible. That future is today, it is now, so what is its expression?</p><p>Well I'm at <span style="font-weight:oblique">work</span> so it's hard to even feel anything. I sit dead and dull, unable to feel pride in anything. Part of my decision last night was to feel pride for everything in my life, including the things most difficult to accept. I cannot make any exceptions. Maybe because at work, I don't feel like myself at all. From my appearance down to my mannerisms, I'm completely somebody else.</p><p>And now I feel so frustrated that I'm actually picking my skin until it bleeds. Tearing right through the pain. </p><p>Has anything changed? Yes I am a little worried. Maybe I saw a new way to get through the difficult moments. I realize now there isn't just one thing I must focus on every time I want to change. I have to bring everything together again, every single thought I have about how to improve, and create a new way of living. </p><p>Improving each of these things is like climbing a mountain. Maybe yesterday I didn't climb a mountain, maybe I only saw how tall and jagged it is. I'm at the foot of it, and I've accepted that to move on, I must go over it.</p><p>Mountains:<br /><ul><br /><li>Accept all obstacles in my life as mine, regardless of origin</li><br /><li>Use my personal power to guide others to their own truths</li><br /><li>Realize no one controls me, and I do not control anyone (especially my closest friends)</li><br /></ul></p><p>I think that may be a good start!</p>
