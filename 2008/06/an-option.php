			<p>(egoscue log: been feeling pain in the right knee, back of right hip aches when doing exercises, especially static wall with splits. left ankle pain had subsided a few days ago then started up again full strength.)</p><p>I'm supposed to be keeping track of how I feel every day. But I am sick of it. For the past two years my blog entries have all been just boring stuff about my body and I'm so sick of it now. I hate it. I just want to die so that I don't have to have a stupid body. My body sucks. It's so useless. I am so healthy but my body just has so many problems that I can't even figure out why anything hurts anymore. It's all so confusing and out of whack. It's a puzzle with no solution. I don't want to live with arthritis and have to get a car, or people to take care of me, or medications. If I can't live on my own, without stuff I don't care to have (that people shouldn't have to live with, like cars, etc) then I would rather die. I am a useless human if my body can't exist without pain. I say this first with passion, and then I say it with no passion. It's a mere fact. It is thusly. There is no alternative. I would not feel bad for killing my own body off if I had to. Given the right circumstances, I would. I am making every honest effort that I have any knowledge of in this world at this time to get my body to stop hurting, to set bones right and let muscles develop. But I cannot do any more than the maximum that I can do. If that does not suffice, and since I will never surrender to numbing the pain (which causes greater deterioration due to ignorance) or living with comforts that any able-bodied human should not need, then I will die. I must die. I have a mind that is capable of looking at things objectively and deciding the manner of my own life and death. And I will use it.</p><p>Nothing is a crime. All actions are choices. Also I have little for which to continue living. I have no close friends, but there are a few people who seem to worry and care about me. And I suppose everyone is selfish, so even they must only be trying to show caring for some ulterior motive. That's fine, whatever. If it would bother them that I die, it would only bother them out of their self-concern, which is a personal thing that each person must endure. I think only my parents might be so fortunate as to feel something beyond selfishness, and that blessing my death can never adulterate. It is golden. They are great people. If I miss anyone in the world it will be the two of them, that I could not bask in their love for more moments to come, that I could not marvel at the mystery. But it would be greedy of me to want so much, anyway. Being aware of it is enough, I think.</p><p>Pursuits? What pursuits have I any real claim to, anyway? Art, music, hacky sack, bikes, Japanese, cooking--all will live on without me just perfectly fine. It's ridiculous even to have to say that. Will I miss those things? What a silly question; I'll be dead. I still feel that nothing is worth doing if it isn't any fun. An unfortunate corollary is that any type of fun in life does not exist in a vacuum. Fun and not fun can weigh against one another, and when not fun becomes the heavier of the two, it's time to skip town. It doesn't matter what "fun" things had existed. It's all meaningless if the not fun wins. And the not fun is the pain, the inability to express oneself with movement (i.e. what I've had varying degrees of since the accident), alienation (which is inevitable when you are so different that no one can relate to you). People empathize with humans with qualities similar to their own. If people cannot empathize with you (because of gross differences), then you are less of a human, less useful, less deserving of life. It is the same reason people argue that torturing, killing, and eating animals is okay because "they're just animals, they don't feel". But if those animals had human faces that could move similarly to their own human faces, those people would wonder, "maybe they are in pain.." Empathy is a measure of humanity, inversely a measure of alienation.</p><p>Yeah I have a human face, but I have an inhuman life experience. An experience so far removed that I belong nowhere.</p><p>I disagree with anyone who says that I would have to be mighty arrogant to really believe that I am so different from others. I haven't met a single person who can understand what my life experience is like. I hear things like, "oh it's so hard, I know. I can't imagine" and blah blah blah. You know what? Fine, that's great. I appreciate all that pointless noise.  But you still don't get it, and perhaps you can't, and who cares if you can't. It is neither avoidable nor unacceptable. I can roll with it. Possibly out of the almost 7 billion people out there, some few might actually understand, and that's fine, too. It doesn't matter to me. They're not around.</p><p>If someone were to question me, to challenge me, to share it all, to make it palpable for their understanding, I could perhaps try.. But you'd have to be a really close friend for it to work, for me to even feel like I can express anything. I may even choose not to express anything. And you'd have to be astute enough to realize that I'm just going to be who I am and do what I do--and no single piece of it is not my experience. It is all completely necessary, there's no piece too small to ignore for the sake of understanding. But seriously, would anyone want to analyze me down to the core like that? What a useless exercise. No, even if someone wanted to, I would save them the trouble and just send them on their way.</p><p>This is all so stupid. I hate writing anything these days. This might be the only thing I've written in utter honesty for many months. There's little satisfaction in it, but it's something. It doesn't surpass the threshold of satisfaction that would tip the scales to the positive side. It seems pretty bleak right now. I have some surprising ups now and then, and there's no reason for it. I don't actively search for a reason, either, I just enjoy feeling something different for a change. If the reason doesn't pop out with a bit of probing, I leave it be. Why sabotage a good thing? Anything that makes life a bit more bearable is welcome. There might have been a time when all this pain and nonsensical life was just an aberration on a longer timeline dominated by good. But after this much time, so many long dull moments of unbearable heaviness, I can hardly see what an overall good would have felt like. It's more the opposite now.. I don't know. It doesn't sound too great to say all this, so I don't feel like saying it, for fear that it all sounds mopey. Actually it's meant to be a statement of facts. Facts and figures about how I really feel. Feeling is scientific, too. If you're not happy, it's not just fluff, It's real feeling that has a real value. </p><p>I have conversations like these running through my mind, conversations I never had before: "I'm so sick of all this. I don't want to see a doctor so much anymore. Things are not improving. I've seen so many doctors and therapists, who cares."</p><p>"You're just giving up too soon. You don't know if things can't get better. I bet you they can. Keep at it a bit longer."</p><p>"But it's been two and a half years. I don't want to grieve for myself anymore. If I can't just live peacefully, let me go."</p><p>"Oh come on. Yeah it's stressful, but you're only 24. If you can pull through this level of stress now, and really work toward arming yourself with valuable knowledge about self-care, then things could be so much better in the future. You might be a very happy, peaceful old lady."</p><p>"Don't dangle carrots in front of my face like I'm a fucking retard. I'm not so myopic as to be oblivious to the Catch in such a belief. Yeah, so I go through all this seemingly endless stuff now, what, for the 'future'? What future is that? There is only this moment. Even if every moment after this stressful period was pure bliss, these moments could never be erased, and so how could there be anything such as happiness?"</p><p>"In that case, even if you ceased to exist now, what if you continued to have memories of mortification and pain and alienation? Then why kill yourself? What's the point of that?"</p><p>"You assume that I'm trying to solve something. It's okay. I am living at this moment with whatever memories, whatever ill effects my life has had on my spirit. Yes, I may simply choose to cease to exist. It may prove to be more worthwhile than continuing. Economics. A choice between being distracted with other things (or whatever "not existing" consists of), and enduring pain forever (what the current "existing" seems to consist largely of). I have become so engrossed in my pain and fighting it with whatever power I have, that life is about nothing more than avoiding pain. That is not fun. Not existing, even if I don't know anything about it, is merely a possibility that is open to me."</p><p>At this point, really the only possible responses are full of goading and pleading and whining. It's pretty pathetic, so this first voice wins. Wins nothing. It's not a contest.</p>
