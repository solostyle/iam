			<h2>Jing Luo</h2>
			<h3>26 June 2008  @ 00:28</h3>
			<p>This is Week 24 of work. It's actually week 26, which means we've crossed the halfway mark for 2008 by the end of this week, but I started work on the second week of the year, on Coming of Age Day in Japan. </p><p>I think I'd like to gain better control over my body using my mind. Sure I can speak without stuttering, improve my swimming, stay on beat, and balance on one leg. But I want inner peace and self-control. I recently learned how to swallow pills--reliably. Before, it seemed random whether I would be able to or not. I seemed to have no connection between the mind and the body. I would think, "swallow, swallow" and my body would refuse. Now I can reliably pop a pill in, without any water or anything else, and it goes down with just a little effort. </p><p>This simple thing has opened me up to trying other things. I don't know when I'll start, but I'm enjoying letting the ideas grow in my mind for a bit first. I started out reading about <a href="http://www.jalanetipot.com/">Jala Neti</a> and <a href="http://www.soul-guidance.com/health/neti.htm">its benefits</a>. Then I found <a href="http://www.jalanetipot.com/stomach.html">other types of cleansing procedures</a>. There are many more cleansings than just these, and so much more than just cleansing. All of Yoga and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Complete-System-Self-Healing-Internal-Exercises/dp/B000LU8Q82">Qi Gong practice</a> is very good. I think one could spend half of every day doing all these daily practices. (Perhaps in the far future when I can live well enough on a part time job, I will be able to do this.)</p><p>They say, especially for the Yoga cleanses, that having a facilitator or mentor guide you at first is important. I can't do that. I mean, where is there anyone like that around me? I am not going to go on a retreat just to learn how to do things the "right" way. It is probably good to do, but if bodily wisdom is truly that, anyone should be able to understand and learn just by listening to oneself. </p><p>Armed with these practices, perhaps one will never need arthritis medication, so-called physical therapy (even the best is a waste), surgery, chemotherapy, annual physical exams, dental care, hormone replacement therapy, etc. I wonder about Massage, however. That seems to be endlessly useful. Stretching, breathing, exercising, Bikram Yoga, and lake swimming might do the trick, though. If you're always moving and balancing your muscles and bones, massage may not be necessary anymore.</p><p>I hope I'll do this again tomorrow, but at lunch today (I wasn't that hungry) I looked through some <a href="http://www.redwingbooks.com/products/books/WebThaHasNo.cfm">Acupuncture</a> <a href="http://www.redwingbooks.com/products/books/GraWin.cfm">books</a> and tried to feel each meridian. Someone wanted to sit at the table with me but I shoo'ed her away. I love having that opportunity. I always feel better when I tell people honestly that I want to be left alone. Hee. It's not the best thing to do this right in the middle of the day with a hundred people around you in a cafeteria. But it doesn't matter--when you want to do it, you can.</p><p>I messed up my sleep schedule today. I had a crazy bowel movement earlier today, too. My body has been struggling to balance itself out. I should go rest.</p><p></p>
