			<h2>Egoscue Treatment 1</h2>
			<h3>11 June 2008  @ 07:59</h3>
			<p>Yesterday afternoon was my first Egoscue treatment with Sharon Fontes. She took pictures of my relaxed standing posture and diagrammed symptoms. She came up with a menu of exercises I should try to do daily for the next two weeks. It will be fun and challenging.</p><p>This is a journal to keep track of how I respond to the exercises. Before yesterday's session I felt tension in my left thigh and hip, right knee, left ankle more than right ankle, and left shoulder. After the exercises and for the remainder of the day I started to feel more soreness in my right thigh and hip, especially the outer region, more activity (warmth, soreness) in my right psoas area, pinching in the lateral side of my left ankle (as if it were resetting), a feeling of wanting to release and relax the left shoulder behind the scapula, and general more openness in the pelvic scoop. I'm calling the squishy region on my front side from the top of my hips to my pubic bone the pelvic scoop. Lower-abs just doesn't capture it properly.</p><p>This morning I feel okay. I did a few stretches to get my shoulders back. They felt really good. It's the same exercise Dr. Garcia gave to Nick. You stand in a doorway with your palms near the edges, elbows bent, and lean forward to pull your shoulders back. My upper back posture "looks" right but it's an illusion--I lean back to make my back straighter but my shoulders are still slightly rounded forward.</p><p>As I walk around I notice other people's postural issues and it's pretty interesting. I don't make comment, of course, but I think about what exercises could help them. You can tell from the posture what muscles are tight or need strengthening. There's this one guy at work who has excellent posture. He's really handsome, too. He keeps his head shaved down to the skin, his head is a beautiful shape, and he looks like some kind of athlete. He's always walking fast, and I have no idea who he is. I wonder if I'll ever meet him.</p><p></p>
