			<h2>Drums</h2>
			<h3>29 June 2008  @ 17:24</h3>
			<p>I've been playing drums most of the day today, off and on, thanks to this guy, <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search_query=vansdrumming&search_type=&aq=f">Randy van Patten</a>. He is inspiring me to play better. Not that I need much inspiration to improve, since my playing is generally pretty novice, but even though this guy is good, he is funny and explains things practically. I love his attitude. All the other video lessons I've seen are pedantic and wordy.</p><p>I flipped my drums around so that I play the left foot on the bass pedal and the right on the hihat pedal. I still play the right hand on the snare and the left on the hihat, but now my arms are crossed. That certainly feels strange.. but a great benefit is that I get to use the left hand to lead on the toms. And I get to use the left hand on the ride cymbal!! All this time when I was playing with a righty setup, I have had to play the ride with the right hand, which made me pretty good at being ambidextrous. The only thing now is that if I am really serious about playing this way (serious about playing? nah, i hope i'm never serious), It will be difficult to switch back to the righty setup, if I ever wanted to take lessons or play on someone else's set. But I don't care about that.</p><p>Man my left foot is really weak! It makes me wonder if I'm really left-footed. I wonder if the drums have made me a righty.</p>
