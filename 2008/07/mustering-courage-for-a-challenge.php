			<h2>Mustering courage for a challenge</h2>
			<h3>24 July 2008  @ 10:48</h3>
			<p>Yesterday I refilled the two-and-a-half gallon water jug at Osco. I walked back carrying it only with my right arm. My goal was to walk half of the way without resting. I did. When I did rest, it was not for long. It was a small victory but I kept telling myself, "it's just like doing Tai Chi." If i want to hone my self-control, I need to fight. When Master Choi is there, I don't quit. But when he isn't there, I quit easily. I have to do it for someone or something. Just myself is not enough. But I'm already doing a lot for myself: Like being thrifty and fixing body issues. I have the strength to take on challenges. It is time to challenge. *Sigh*</p>
