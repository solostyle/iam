			<p>it didn't happen. i still feel tight in that hip. how disappointing? not that disappointing... i figured it was just a fluke. i can't wait for friday. oh friday friday.</p><p>ugh. i've been doing this since the end of february... it's now july. how much longer? i think i've improved more than 50%, but what if the remainder takes longer? i'm sure there's diminishing returns as i get closer to superhero ability. i'd be happy enough at 80%, i think, but i still wouldn't let it go until i was as close to 100% as possible. </p>
