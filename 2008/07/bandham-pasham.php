			<h2>Bandham pasham</h2>
			<h3>29 July 2008  @ 20:00</h3>
			<p>I just did 182 lunges this muggy evening. I did 25 pairs of forward walking lunges, followed by 25 sideways lunges, and 25 more leading with the other leg. Then I did 16 pairs of forward walking lunges before crapping out. I followed that up with a strong set of 50 more sideways lunges. This is getting to be too easy. I need to add weights next time.</p><p>I came home and felt like talking to my mom. We talked for a loooong time about marriage and good versus bad people, martial arts, swimming, studying something health-related and becoming a teacher or professor, calcium and magnesium and how they affect the autonomous nervous system, bone density versus bone quality, menopause, vaginal dryness. Lots of stuff. All kinds of stuff! She said, bless my mummy's heart, that every time she talks to me she feels so intelligent and like she's learning a lot. She says I seem really interested in nutrition and health and genetics and that if I studied it, I would understand it very quickly.</p><p>She's probably right about that, since I have already read a lot about it, but I'm slow to trust any educational program, philosophy, or institution. It even took me a while to trust the company where I work. But now I am much less paranoid and actually even a little comfortable. I make light-hearted jokes and whatnot. I completely trust martial arts, like Tai Chi, because I have done it before and felt some pretty spectacular things. So I feel confident about wanting to continue that study. I have studied microbiology and a little bit of organic chemistry on my own, and I enjoyed the courses. I could continue to study these hard sciences no problem. But when it comes to an actual field of study, like nutritional genetics, I'm still pretty wary about the whole thing. I was really turned on to it when I discovered it last year or so, and I devoured books on it. I never lost interest. But now after reading about it in the various online and print media, I'm not sure I really want to be a part of that. It seems like a new fad in some ways. I kind of pray that it slips under the radar again.</p><p>So then my grandmother called, my mom's mom, and we talked for some time. I learned some new vocab from her--pasham bandham. The kind of connection I have with my mom and dad. I told her how in my younger days I didn't feel close to my parents, didn't talk to them as much as I do now. But now I do talk to them, and I really enjoy it. I want them to know lots of things about me. I hope one day I can even tell them about all my various exploits with interesting and not-so-interesting boys. (None of them were men, alas.) But until then, I can talk to them about almost anything. So my grandmother said, that's pasham bandham, or bandham pasham... the bond and love between two people.</p><p>And really my parents are like one person to me. How interesting. They even long ago said something to that effect to me. That mother is father and father is mother. That talking to either of them is like talking to both of them. It was so neat today when I spoke to my mom, I felt that I was also talking to my dad! Ugh. I'm all heart-achy. I want to go home!</p>
