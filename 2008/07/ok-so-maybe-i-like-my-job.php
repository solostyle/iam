			<h2>OK, so maybe I like my job</h2>
			<h3>21 July 2008  @ 11:51</h3>
			<p>Ugh, before I start writing about the topic on my mind, I have to mention--my right hip is screaming at me right now. Ack. It just started suddenly. What is going on? It feels like stinging pinched nerves all in my right low back. Holy Moly. </p><p>There's something else I wanted to mention, but that's not on the topic of my job, but it, too, is more interesting right now--Last night as I was falling asleep I had a distinct memory of being in the hospital bed a few years ago. I don't know if maybe working on my body a bit before bed got me in the frame of mind to be able to remember this, but I distinctly remembered that during those three weeks in bed, I couldn't prop up my right foot/leg. It was so heavy with all the crap it was wrapped in and all the swelling that it would always fall to the side, the outside, so that my toes were pointing outward. I remember trying to use my thigh and hip muscles to turn it back inward so that the foot was upright and the knee was facing the ceiling, but it hurt too much (what with the pelvis broken, too) so I had to let it fall.</p><p>Now, I'm aware that turning the foot to face outward locks up the sacro-iliac joint to where the muscles of the butt and hip cannot be engaged. I put two and two together and realized... my goodness, the weakness in my right hip due to muscular atrophy, the tightness in my right outer thigh and laxity in the inner thigh, the dysfunction of my femur's ball and socket joint--all of these are directly related to my memory of lying in that strange supine position in bed for weeks. Having lain in that position may even be responsible for what I'm feeling now. If I had had some support for my leg and foot during the initial healing process, I may have healed in a more balanced way and may not have had such a difficult post-hospital healing process.</p><p>So how do I fix this? I don't know yet, unless it means more of what I'm doing already. But I'm definitely going to tell Sharon and Dr. Rugg this afternoon at therapy.</p><p>Now, on to the subject of my job... oh, time's up.</p>
