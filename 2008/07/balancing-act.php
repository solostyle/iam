			<h2>Balancing act</h2>
			<h3>29 July 2008  @ 13:02</h3>
			<p>I did a bunch of lunges last Friday, 200 to be exact, and felt great doing them. My balance and posture has improved so much that I hardly had to touch the ground with my fingertips to right myself--something I had to do before all these positive changes. It feels about as enjoyable to do them as it did three years ago. I'm pretty pleased. Ah, it's like I can relax about something at last. Of course I still have to work hard and be vigilant about posture and alignment, but I'm in a good place now so I can improve faster.</p><p>Other things on the scale of Libra: <br /><ul><br /><li><em>Work / Life.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm definitely getting more interested in personal pursuits again. It's been so long since I've been in a stable sort of place where I can actually feel inspired to process my own inner stuff. Instead of just sleeping all the time. I've got this website to update and Chinese, Japanese, and French to keep learning.</li><br /><li><em>Family.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;and Tamil. I get to talk to my parents in Tamil quite frequently. It's enjoyable. It's the only non-English language I can speak conversationally because I don't have Japanese, Chinese, or French friends. Although....Will at work speaks French. Perhaps I can brush up on it a bit and try a little conversation.</li><br /><li><em>Friends.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit of a rocky road, as I seem to be losing some friends from Houston. But easy come, easy go, I think. Many people are just not into having a really good friendship. I'm not that unique, but I have never had the kind of shallow friendship that some of my friends prefer. I'm sure in time I will be able to balance out my own needs internally, and attract people who seek the kind of friendships that I seek. In time. I've been so patient and diligent about physical health; so why not work the same way with the rest?</li><br /></ul></p><p>And that goes not just for friendship but also for personal pursuits at home and professional and personal development at work. Family is a great buffer. I've gotten so much closer to my parents over the past few months (and years, in fact). I want to go home.</p>
