			<p>I keep picking up stuff off the side of the road. Yesterday I picked up a red milk crate. It looks to be solid and in good condition. This morning I picked up a small card table that looks to be of IKEA quality. It has the same faux-wood poly finish that many IKEA products have. I'm not sure how I will use them exactly, but there they are. Ah, perhaps I will go out to the porch to write.</p><p>I've decided I'm going to write to Kouichi-san.</p>
