			<h2>Real improvement</h2>
			<h3>08 July 2008  @ 19:34</h3>
			<p>I can't believe it! Okay I don't want to get too excited about it, but for two days my hips have felt really good. I still feel tension in the front part, but the sacroiliac joint in the back feels tension-free. I don't know yet if it's lasting improvement or just a fleeting fluke. I can't wait for Friday when hopefully Sharon will kick the shit out of that joint again. I hope to be screaming and wailing; that's the way to improvement. every time she makes it hurt like that i feel better later on... although until now it's been minor improvements. and i'll keep downing four bromelain+enzyme pills a day. and i'll keep swimming my best every day, too. and i'll do those egoscue exercises the most that i can. and i'll blah blah blah ENOUGH! i'm tired of always thinking about my body and health.  most of the time i do it out of vigilance and concern. i'm trying to catch things before they worsen. the rest of the time i do it because it's good for anyone to do and it's fun and because in general it's good to live consciously. but soon soon that vigilance and concern will have to go. i must take risks again. i can't live in fear of danger forever. and hopefully i will have learned something from all this self-nursing. stronger because i will know how to untwist tissues and coax bones back to their homes. braver because a strong body means a strong mind.</p>
