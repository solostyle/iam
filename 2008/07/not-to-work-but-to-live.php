			<h2>not to work but to live</h2>
			<h3>09 July 2008  @ 18:19</h3>
			<p>i'm still trying to figure this out, but i feel currently like not having a job. i guess i've felt this way long before i even started working.. i just don't see any reason to work. i honestly don't think that any kind of industry work would make my life more meaningful. if anything so far it seems to be confusing and makes life more meaningless overall, or gives it a false sense of purpose--that's the confusing part. it's a sense of purpose that other people seem to be satisfied with, so i try to see that perspective. at least i <em>try</em> to see another perspective before doubting the whole thing. i've been a vacillating vache. yesterday i was teetering onto the side of wanting to stick around and become manager and work for 3 years. today i'm back to where i feel "safest"--in my utter abhorrence of corporations and progress. and i say all that tongue-in-cheek. i don't really mean that i feel "safest" in cynicism... it just seems that way because i keep coming back to it, but from different perspectives. it's always new but reminiscent of the same old feeling. and to say that i utterly abhor the norm is too strong. but similarly... i keep coming back to that same old feeling. i don't think i'm set in my ways, but i seem to really dislike a lot of this stuff, repeatedly.</p><p>like today i was just thinking, "get paid more to do more of the things i don't like to do? lame." so the last thing i want to do is move up in the job. staying put in the same place at a job is pretty lame, too, though. it would give your whole life a sense of stagnancy, what with other people moving onward and upward. at my work place, that's how it is. people enter into the job in "classes" and move up all together, so they form these little tightly knit social groups. the people who are hired into my class were just recently hired, so i'm most senior of them all, but ugh.. i don't really want to do this, .. but i'll just have to see how things evolve. my hypothesis is that i will still be an outsider despite all the socializing.</p><p>i don't care if there are people in the world who would trade their jobs with mine today. at first i did give that notion a bit of weight. but now, i'm back to that same old feeling that eww i don't want to be here, and so forth. and now, i don't feel guilty or ungrateful about it, either. i understand why i have a problem with this lifestyle, and no matter how good it might be for many people, it isn't right for me. i hung out in the warehouse today and thought about how most of the warehouse workers are really cool and how nick would probably get by working as one, with great benefits and pay and he could live close to me, etc.. it was just a thought exercise to entertain what it might be like if more friends were around. i don't know.. sounds attractive, but i think it might still be boring and annoying, not just living in elmhurst (which isn't that bad), but having no one else but each other, and work is still a drag. work is a drag no matter what kind of work it is. </p><p>another thing that annoys me is that now i feel like i'm in some special sector of society. i can't work as a warehouse worker at my company--unless as a supervisor for an area, because it's a higher position for a manual-labor job. they would never hire me into a manual labor type job. it's out of my league. i'm an intellectual, and i can now only work as someone on the way to being a project manager. if i tried to get a job somewhere else doing something much less skilled than what i do now, people would clearly see that i am overqualified (or differently qualified?)... in any case, they would point out quite plainly that i should be working in a more development/design job. sure, and i'm aware of that, or i wouldn't say it myself. nonetheless the thing that bothers me is that i just curtsied through life without really thinking too much and here is where i am now... and it feels a bit too arbitrary. i've already fallen into a hole that fits my "shape"... or so everyone thinks. it doesn't explain why i'm so uncomfortable about this whole thing and just want to tear it off me like some slimy mask that might solidify in place if i didn't. </p><p>so i worked a whole lot this week, and i kind of hope to leave early tomorrow. i'm just going to come in later and leave earlier. i think that's the only way to really get extra time. but i don't think it's allowed. i've seen that people plan to work full days everyday and if it goes over, then it goes over and that's too bad for you. mayyyyybe you can leave a little earlier later in the week, like on friday, but not that much earlier. at least, it doesn't seem like you're supposed to completely average out the days. if you work an extra few hours during the week, you can maybe duck out a half hour earlier on friday. eeyyah, pretty lame. well i'm not doing that crap. i'm going to have things "scheduled" which require that i leave when i want to. i worked 9 hours on monday, normal day tuesday, and 8.5 today. technically i can take 2.5 hours off, but if i'm really expected to work 8 hours (instead of 7.5), then i can take 1.5 hours off. </p><p>isn't this stupid? but at any other company i'm sure i would be expected to work extra time often and with zeal. even stupider!<br /></p>
