			<h2>oh god, kill me now</h2>
			<h3>11 April 2008  @ 07:28</h3>
			<p>I've really had it. It's only, what, the end of the third month of working here and I'm just itching to get out. I stared at my window while in bed this morning, looking at the weird shapes of my drums through the imperfections of my bare eyes, and tried to find a reason to go to work. When I finally stood up and went outside, I decided I'd go just for the bike ride up there. Of course if I was really going to do that, I'd say FUCK work and just ride my bike all day. It's so nice out. There's a light drizzle now and then, but the sky is ravaged with storm-torn clouds and the morning sunlight dapples over the celestial landscape like paint over a textured canvas. The wind is warm. The air is cool. And wind and air are now separate, battling it out like rebellion and compliance. </p><p>Yeah so what the weather is nice <em>now</em>, but there's still the matter of a winter that knows no bounds. I am not fooled. Doubtless I will enjoy these days, the portion of the days that are not spent here in this vacuum of life-energy, but I'm itching to get out. With my current income and the current price of food and shit, I am on the road to saving $20 grand a year. Yeah, you heard me. I knew it all along, I'm only just telling you now. Hey why not throw some real numbers out there. Who reads this thing anyway.</p><p>So given that massive sum, I could have $100 grand in less than five years. I could do a good deal with that much money. I would definitely be able to quit and work part time somewhere else while enjoying more of my day for myself. But would I really get to do what I want? That might take a bit more. That might require buying a piece of unincorporated, unzoned land all for fun and amusement. Yes, life should be fun, dammit. And fuck all of you who think otherwise. So how much money would that take? Maybe a good $20 grand, maybe that would be it. But the life that comes with it... I would need transportation of some kind, a bunch of seeds and food to sustain me while they germinate, a shelter that I'd build myself which takes a lot of materials and labor, some good animals, electricity and power from my own sources (wind, solar, hydro, my own power), and lots of heart. If I really want to sustain myself, I might need to learn more about agriculture from the Maya. Possibly use their maize and beans and whatever else grows well together.</p><p>All that stuff together might take a good $100 grand total if I don't make too many mistakes. Chances are I'll buy the wrong land, or it will prove to be infertile, or my shelter will crumble. Whatever, I could just live in a tent. But then I also wonder.. yeah I could maybe make a life like this for myself, it's definitely possible, but is that really the best way? I know there are people like me somewhere doing this thing who need help doing it, who would welcome a new face. It's relatively cheap, I'd say, to travel around looking at different farms run by families or co-ops and see how they spend their time and how well they support themselves. Even if I don't find a place that suits me, I would learn a lot just seeing how much the land yields each afternoon, and over the course of the entire year, even the low harvest winter months. </p><p>I only get seven days off this year. It blows. I keep wondering what I could with that time. I feel like thinking so far into the future (i.e. more than a few months) is just too hard right now. I only just started working and hating life. My hate is yet a wee bern (said with scottish accent). I want to do a long trip, camping, hiking, biking, all that stuff together. I also want to do a few long rides with groups of people--these I can just do on weekends instead of taking weekdays. That would give me something to look forward to each week. But I also want to observe and work with people on farms. I don't think I can go to another country to do this with only 7 days, 11 with two weekends. Hm.. Maybe it could work. It would have to be a solid trip, like I would have to be confident that the place where I'll be is a good learning experience. Doing a backpacking/hiking/biking trip would rock because of the physical and mental training, and also the immense joy of being outside. </p><p>I still don't really know. It seems like it has to be one or the other. I think I want a good learning experience foremost. Physical and mental training comes from consistent training. Doing pullups everyday, biking over 100 miles a week, running (if I ever can), swimming long distances in open water against wind and chops, standing still for an hour building energy. I even want to start sleeping outside on my porch. I wonder what that would be like.. Who can stop me? No one, really. And the train would be loud and squealing, but maybe it will <em>train</em> me to sleep in loud places.</p><p>I'll continue.</p>
