			<h2>Week 15</h2>
			<h3>21 April 2008  @ 12:25</h3>
			<p>Except that I'm not at work today. I am taking today off as a sick day. I can't do anything at the computer anyway. Except this typing. I just have to record this... I have been having a pity party all by my lonesome all weekend. I just needed a good massage to get my arm back in order. It has been difficult to sleep at night because it hurts. I'm taking today off from work, but I'm going to go to the gym with some food and lots of water and really work on strengthening my hips, shoulders, arms, wrists, shins, calves, basically everything. I have so many physical problems. But my heart is strong and I'm still really fit. It's kind of unbelievable. I learn more and more everyday--and it's usually just when I'm about to give up.</p>
