			<h2>Improvements and costs</h2>
			<h3>01 April 2008  @ 10:29</h3>
			<p>The past three weeks of therapy and adjustment have brought many new changes in my body. My posture has improved, my neck and lower back don't hurt anymore, and I can sit for longer periods of time at work.  On the other hand, my right SI (sacroiliac)  joint and the connective tissue near the sacrum feel funny or sore a lot of the time, my heels are killing me (plantar fasciitis), and I've discovered that the right leg still is much weaker than I thought. </p>
