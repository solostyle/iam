			<p>i had my first performance review today, and apparently i'm off to great start in my career. i expect no less from myself. even if it's something i don't like, if it's something i have decided to do anyway, i must excel. yeah i wonder why it took me this long to verbalize it, but it feels natural to me. </p>
