			<h2>A Quick Note</h2>
			<h3>02 August 2008  @ 15:05</h3>
			<p>Weeks ago, when I did the static wall splits, I couldn't hold it for more than 15 or 20 seconds. Some time later, I tried it again but more intensely. I focused very hard, cheered myself on, and felt an enormous pop in my right hip. After that, it was sore but relieved. After that time, I could hold the pose for a minute with some difficulty. Now I can hold the pose for more than a minute with less difficulty, and when the hip needs to, it pops right away without much struggle. It's great!</p>
