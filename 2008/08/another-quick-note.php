			<h2>Another Quick Note</h2>
			<h3>11 August 2008  @ 15:00</h3>
			<p>Yesterday morning I jogged to the gym and lifted weights. I could bench press more than usual, even though I hadn't pumped iron in a week. When I say bench press, I mean with individual weights, not the bar. I normally do 20 lbs on each side, but yesterday I could do 25 lbs. I did 20 lbs at 10 (or was it 12?) reps, then upped to 25 lbs and did 8 reps, then stayed at 25 lbs and did another 8 reps. That's pretty good. I think I'll keep trying to do that until it becomes easy.</p><p>I'm sure running to the gym helped me pump more blood to the muscles. I should keep this in mind.</p>
