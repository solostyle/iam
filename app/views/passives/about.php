This blog explores ideas and chronicles my experiences as a student of the internal arts. I've been studying meditation for a number of years, becoming more involved in recent years. The Chinese Qi Gong tradition was my first introduction to the meditation with which I most resonate today. I have also discovered the principles of Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga and incorporate them into my Hatha Yoga practice. I have created an integrated practice for myself that addresses my day-to-day imbalances. I try to talk about ideas and experiences here that I think are worth sharing with others, and I hope that it serves some purpose in your life. Namaskara.
