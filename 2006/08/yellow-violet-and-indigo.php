			<h2>Yellow, violet, and indigo!</h2>

			<p><p>I've been having great fun by myself lately, but I don't feel like I'm by myself at all! This morning I ran faster than ever before! I did an 8-minute mile, but I was absolutely beat afterwards. The sweat kept dripping into my eyes and burning. Then I came home and took the coldest shower I could. Oh it was divine! I don't usually take such lovely showers. I'm usually in and out in five minutes, but today I completely lost track of time and instead was so engaged in the moment. I cleaned every little part of me thoroughly and even washed my hair. Now that my nails are long, I can actually scrub the dirt out of my hair. Then I sat outside on the platform in the middle of the hallway and read my Japanese book. The wind blows so strongly that I think whenever I can't bear being in my apartment, I'll just sleep on this balcony instead. I'll close the door so that no one can see me. And it's safe because it's four floors up. I doubt anyone will even care, especially on a week night. Ah, I love summer. It's only hot in my apartment. It isn't hot at all outside. From about noon until 2pm I wouldn't volunteer to be outside, unless I was in the shade, but otherwise, it's quite nice. Everyday I hear people complaining about the heat. Haha. They are missing out!</p><br /><p>Out my window in the parking lot I saw two black ladies parking their car, and when they parked, the driver aimed badly and hit the neighboring car right behind the rear wheel. She backed out and tried again and made it in. There was no one in sight, but I SAW!! I'm a witness, and I'll tell! But so anyway I wanted to see what they would do. Would they get out and examine the other car to see how much damage was done? Surely they would check their own car. But would you believe it! They got out, passed the dent on the other car without even looking, went straight to the scratch on their own car, even touched it a few times, looking carefully, and then turned and walked back--past the dent on the other car again, without even looking! Hahaha! I even clapped, hoping they'd hear me, but they didn't. I seriously imagined that they'd check the other car first, but they didn't look at all! I think that would have been my reaction. I care more about the ripples I send, especially the ones I don't intend to send. I wonder what most people would do.</p><br /><p>Then my UPS package came. Whoever brought it actually went into the building, up to the top floor, to my apartment and put it IN my apartment! I leave my door open all the time, because who would want anything of mine anyway (it's all cheap), and I like letting the air circulate. I now have a working power cord for my laptop! Phew. I was getting worried that my battery would run out before I got it.</p><br /><p>While I was sitting outside reading my Japanese book, I noticed the shadows moving. I actually stared at the shadow to see if I could detect the movement. And I could! I saw the shadow's edge creep closer and closer to me as the sun approached the zenith. It was very very slow, and it seemed to move in the same rhythm as my breathing. But that might have been because my attention was moving with my breath. Strange how perception changes when you stretch it out. But that was so cool. I felt like I grew closer to heaven right then.</p><br /><p>I've been drinking a lot of water and other liquids lately. I drink a LOT of coconut water. It's so delicious and quenching. And cold cold water is great, too. I'm going to use those ice trays in my freezer and sit outside drinking ice as it melts in the heat.</p><br /><p>I filed my nails on the bus today! I was dripping with sweat and I couldn't see my nails whenever I got sweat in my eyes, but how fun! I felt like such a prep!</p><br /><p>Last night I talked to Nick on the phone and he told me about the Gallon Challenge. It's where you drink a gallon of milk in an hour. Or die trying! Muahahaha! They've never been able to do it, but one guy almost did it. Everyone ends up throwing up after a certain point. So ridiculous. It made me think about how nice it would be to live with friends and do silly daredevil things like that. I've never had that... But it's not hard to imagine it.</p><br /><p>Then I took the aura colors test again, and I got mostly Yellow (9), Violet (10), and Indigo (10). Yay! No more blue! I must be back to normal now. I used to be more orange and very little yellow, but I think yellow is healthier than orange, anyway.</p></p>
