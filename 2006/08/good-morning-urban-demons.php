			<h2>Good morning, urban demons</h2>
			<h3>23 August 2006  @ 12:24</h3>
			<p>This morning was a waste. I woke up at 4 to go swimming, but backed out. I didn't feel like biking down to the lake. It's a 10-mile ride I just don't feel like doing right now. The public transportation would get me down there a little later than I would like, and then I wouldn't have a free ride back home until 8 am. So I would have to do nothing for an hour or so.</p><p>I will try again tomorrow morning. Going down there sure beats walking around at Loyola Park, which I did this morning.</p><p>I sat down at a bench facing the sun rise over the lake, and this Hare Krishna priest walked over and sat next to me. He kept talking and talking, being witty and impressive and charming. I was annoyed, but I tend to be too nice. I should have told him to leave me alone.</p><p>Anyway then a friend of his came over and began to act really strange. He got up really close to the priest and started sniffing at his face. Then he kept asking for his clothing so he could try it on and pose. While the priest was talking to me (or at me, I don't know which) his friend kept interrupting and asking me random questions about myself. "Where are you from?" Which I had already told him. "What's your name?" Which the priest had already told him. "Do you actually go to Northwestern? Can you name any professors?" I was getting sick. Then he left to do some business of his and the priest and I continued chatting.</p><p>I learned some interesting things, like that he has been a priest of the Hare Krishna temple(s) for 35 years, but only three years ago did he start enjoying life. He got kicked out of some temple in Florida for posting pictures of himself with beautiful danceclub girls. Since he would wake up at 2 every morning and finish his mantras by 3, he had some time to kill before starting puja. During that time he would hang out at danceclubs and hand out Gitas.</p><p>Weirdo. I also found out that he has two broken hips. One from a horse falling on him, the other from a suicide attempt. He tried jumping out of a 5-story building because of a depression the root cause of which he says is that his elder brother molested him when he was 12.</p><p>Hm.. Let's see. Ah yes, and then we also talked about the Tantra as a valid part of Hindu vedas. He told me a story about having a Tantric yogini for two years. And then he asked me if I would like to be his Tantric yogini. I entertained him a bit by saying, "but I have no experience with Tantric sex." He said he would teach me everything, anything I wanted to know. "Don't I look like a good teacher?" He certainly looked happy, but I said, "no, you don't look like a good teacher."</p><p>After a while he needed to head back to the temple. He asked if I'd like to join him. I really kind of didn't. But hell, I would be walking home in that direction anyway. His friend came back in the nick of time to join us walking back to the temple. The friend began to smoke a cigarette. And while the priest and I were talking about something, the friend interrupted (as he is wont to do) and crouched down to the ground in front of me while I was walking and pointed to the scar on my leg. He blew smoke right in my face. The fucker. I started coughing and moved away from him without even responding to his idiotic gesture and question.</p><p>I think he might have put the cigarette out after that. I have no idea because I was beyond him. He caught up to us again further down the path and began to ask me stupid questions again. I began to seethe inside, got really quiet, and felt this was stupid and not worth it. Normally I would not put up with creeps like him for longer than a split second. But he was friends with this priest guy who was pretty interesting and kind. So I bid them farewell and a final "Hare Krishna."</p><p>Then I took a nap, and when I awoke, I was rage. I didn't do anything or show anger in anyway--but I felt it boiling up inside me. I think I'm okay now, but lord o lord. I just can't stand idiotic men. It makes me despise men of all kinds. What a creep! The only reason I don't meet more people like him is because I generally know that most people are like him--and for that reason I don't talk to many people. If I allowed myself to know more people, I think I would be thoroughly disgusted by humanity. In fact, just meeting one is enough.</p><p>Some women are creeps, too. Most of the women I know who are creeps are manipulative whores who will do anything for sex, marriage, or "love." They are a disgrace to the womanhood of which I am unavoidably a part.</p><p>In the heat of this anger, I began to hate other things, too, like how noisy it is near my apartment all the damn time. Last night as I was trying to sleep, some couple was out there arguing about something stupid. "Come on, let's go!" "I'm not going anywhere with you!" And no, they can't go inside and talk to each other. They have to stand, one in the parking lot, the other in the alley, and YELL across some 50 feet at each other.</p><p>And then this morning during my post-asshole nap the dumptrucks came around. There are about 8 dumpsters right next to my apartment, so I get to hear the banging and dumping and throwing, and of course the massive diesel engine churning and rumbling. And the annoying incessant beeping when it goes in reverse. After it's done with this block, it goes to the neighboring block, and I can still hear the piercing reverse beeping.</p><p>What a waste of a morning it was! It was all noise, noise, noise! Even the sunrise, which would have been lovely, had to have this annoying priestly chattering as its voiceover narrative. Completely incongruous and non sequitur. Ugh. Get me out of this nightmare!</p><p>I want to move out. I want to move out of all cities. I hate cities. Or if I stay in Chicago, there must be a place of serenity and quietude where I can watch sunrises without people trying to sell me their ideas or pick me up. A place with trees, without parking lots full of car alarms, without black people and their family problems that they have to share with the whole world. (And yes, it's only black people who do it. I have no fear of appearing "racist." If you think I'm being racist, you should think about what racism means.) Without dumptrucks and loud engines and beeping and sirens and cigarette smoke from neighbors.</p><p>I'm tired. I'm really fed up.</p><p>Maybe it's worth it to pay an extra $200 a month just to live in a nicer place like Evanston or Wilmette. Is there any place in Chicago like a little Evanston? I haven't seen anything. It seems like you have to have a high tolerance for all this by default. I wish some family who has a big house would rent out their basement to me. A big house in a shady neighborhood with quiet cars and wide streets.</p><p>I've been feeling all this lately, and I think this waste of a morning with its unsightly events unearthed and strengthened these urban demons.</p>
