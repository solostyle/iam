			<h2>Musings on attraction</h2>

			<p>Ah. I think it's a moment of reflection. I want to step back and see clearly.</p><p>Lately, I guess things have been feeling pleasant. True that I don't have much social opportunity, but when it comes, I make the best of it because it is so rare. If I had a more active social life I might tire of it and want to be more alone. I think right now, there is a perfect balance. It keeps me wanting more from people rather than wanting more solitude. That is how it should be. I should always be satisfied with the amount of solitude I get.</p><p>Nick said something last night. Or. He tried to and felt disappointed in himself. I could feel it, too, when he said it. I already knew what he was going to say, and that he was going to have a hard time, and that he would feel disappointed. So much of the time during his speech, in my mind I'm cheering him on, "Come on, don't give up! You can express yourself!" I wonder about the best way to respond to him when that happens. Maybe I should be more like a counselor where I try to express what I think he wants to say in my own words and ask if that's what he means. It's not an effort to change his expression; it's an effort to understand and clarify for myself what I think he's trying to say. It also gives him more ownership over the idea because I'm not saying, "well this is how <em>I</em> feel," but rather "I think this is how you feel--is it?" The mere fact that I can understand how he feels is enough ownership for me. Hmm.. I'm really glad I did that research project with Leema. It has real-life applications!</p><p>Well this is my blog so I'm going to take complete ownership over the idea. I haven't had the same life experience as Nick or Kevin. I have never been like Kevin, putting my heart out for people to step all over it, hoping and wishing for my infatuation to grant me reciprocation. The power struggle with him was such that when he wanted me to reciprocate, I had the upper hand (which I didn't like, but which he believed that I did--in fact, he began to develop this whole concept of me where I am this horribly evil dominatrix stringing him around, not loving him back in order to remain "in control"). But then when he had the upper hand, he would make me feel guilt for hurting his feelings. What a mess. I feel like it was all his doing, too. Granted, I'm the worst person to do that kind of thing to--because I'm really my own person, completely separate from other people, especially when they're living in a fantasy world about me. Other people's perceptions of me do affect me, and I don't like the reflection I see. I think that is why I stopped talking to him. Because that reflection is false. It is <em>his</em> misguided energy. It was the same way with Rakhee when we had hardly corresponded in any way before she decided that I was her best friend. That kind of thing creeps me out. What makes people so desperate?</p><p>Anyway, back on topic. My desperation has pretty much always been internal. I am introverted to the point where all my struggles with the outside world are actually struggles within myself. A few months ago in the middle of my recovery, I began to believe that there were times when the only help I could get was from the outside world. I don't feel that anymore. It feels normal again now. I thought I had changed forever.</p><p>Therefore, I have also never been like Nick because my attraction to other people has always been submerged in the boiling core of my heart.</p><p>But still I can understand both types of people.</p><p>The boiling heart-core isn't limited to attraction; it encompasses every passion. I can be attracted to anything, and every object of attraction is bright. It isn't a desperate want. It's a realization that what the external world pulls in me is what I have in me that I want to be, or what I want to understand.</p><p>The last time I was so turned on for days on end, pleasuring myself every day and night, was after my fallout with Rich and at the dawn of a new correspondence with an Indonesian Ragga-Junglist from Holland. It was also bright. I wasn't desperate for a particular person to love me or to accept me (Rich); my olive-skinned Micha and I simply expressed our fantasies with each other and as a favor for each other, while fully conscious of what we were doing. We were just playing. But it was healthy, sexual affirmation.</p><p>This time it feels different. It's still healthy affirmation, dreamy, fantastical, psycho-physical. It's somehow deeper and more meaningful. I don't know what love is. It's cliche. Love doesn't mean anything. I think it's just a very interesting collection of traits about a person--so many traits that they cannot be held all together in short-term memory (only 5-7 chunks can fit, according to cognitive theory)--and because they cannot be held all together, they form this illusion of what we call Love.</p><p>You like someone so much that they feel like home, and you assign the feeling of "home" to their place in your life.</p><p>See, once you reduce your passion to something this tangible, desperation seems silly. Nothing is worth so much trouble and drama. If attraction with another person doesn't work out in a natural, easy, happy way, it very well may not be worth it at all. For triathlons, marathons, debates, and art, hard work and struggle are worth it. But matters of the heart seem to be completely different. If anything is forced, I feel fake, I feel like all the magic of life is raped.</p>
