			<h2>Power of the Mind</h2>
			<h3>19 August 2006  @ 11:46</h3>
			<p><p>For the past month the triathlon has been pushed out of my mind by fear and lack of enjoyment. I decided after several attempts at swimming in the lake and not getting anywhere (literally) that I would much rather not care about the triathlon at all and just go back to swimming for my own enjoyment.</p><br /><p>Instead I stopped swimming entirely. For better or for worse, I just felt no desire to do it. Swimming the pool just doesn't have the same thrill that it had before I ever tried open water. And yet I couldn't bring myself to do it in the open water! It was as if I desired something in between. What I needed was to swim with someone in open water.</p><br /><p>I think I'm definitely a thrill-seeker. Fear now motivates and titillates me. I don't remember quite being that way before.</p><br /><p>Still feeling down about backing out of the tri, I called Lisa, the therapist who gave me the courage to try the triathlon despite my injury and trauma. She revved me up and said, "If the only reason you don't want to do it is just mental, not physical, then you should do it. You'll never get over the fear otherwise." So I thought about it. Is this fear just mental? When you feel it, it affects your body so much that it seems physical. And is it just fear, or do I really lack the ability to swim open water? Isn't swimming open water something completely different from a pool, that can make you feel ill if you aren't used to it?</p><br /><p>If you believe so, then it is. If you don't believe so, then it isn't. It's the exact same thing that Alan Cohen wrote in this month's issue of Awakening Consciousness. He wrote about healing--that healing takes as long as you think it should take. If you believe that you can heal in a moment, then you can. So much of life is this way. The mind is the most powerful organ in our bodies, affecting us physically, emotionally; but we can have control over even the most basic of human feelings and fears.</p><br /><p>But I haven't figured it all out yet. I still sometimes feel like a victim of my mind. The potential for control is there, but sometimes I still feel trapped. One thing I have learned how to control is anger. It took years, but I'm glad it's under control now. I hope to do the same thing with all aspects of the mind.</p><br /><p>They don't teach you this in school, but it's the most important life lesson! Instead, if they ever want to teach in a way that fosters developing people into responsible citizens in the global community, they teach "values" and other "rules." Society implicitly teaches expedience ("I want it NOW!") and external gratification. If you follow this way of living, why would you ever need to control your mind?</p><br /><p>So how do I get past this swimming road-block? There are many ways, I'm sure, but this is how I do it. Lisa revved me up, but I was still nervous. She said, "I'm going to look up your name after the triathlon, and it is going to be there on the list." I said, "Yeah, I hope so." And she said, "No, it will be." I just thought to myself, "Yeah, whatever." But how does she do it? She doesn't even know me, but this complete stranger has so much power over me! The fact that she expresses my inner desire with conviction might have something to do with it.</p><br /><p>The fear came. And I breathed. Then it went. "Strange," I thought. "I'm scared, but I'm sick of being scared." It was as if I had felt this fear so intensely a month ago, decided that was enough, became fed up and quit being scared. Then when it returned, I was still fed up and simply didn't allow it to return. I laughed, instead. I really laughed. "Poor Archana's afraid of the dark"--just like when I was little. And I'm still laughing, but now for a different reason.</p><br /><p>Yes, you've probably guessed by now. I biked down to Ohio Street. It was cloudy and looked like it would pour, but I checked the Doppler Radar, and it was definitely not going to rain. Parked my bike, slipped on my hat. Waded into the cold water, laughed at the breakers. They're tiny along this shore, but still so lovely. Breakers are the most beautiful part of water.</p><br /><p>A woman in a bikini looking for her friend was up ahead. I started talking to her. I asked if we could swim together. She said okay. We started out together, but she was a bit too fast for me. I lagged behind, quickly realizing that starting at this pace would tire me out well before the 750 meter mark. So she called back, "Are you okay?!" I said I was fine and we continued swimming separately.</p><br /><p>So I swam, and it felt fine. I felt some swells every once in a while, but every time, I sort of gripped my mind really tight as if with a vice and told myself, "Yes, they are swells, but you're fine." Once I even pretended that I was raging through the swells with all my anger pouring out of me, like some kind of mad beast charging forward ferociously. Then I laughed, because it was a funny image, and really, the water wasn't so bad.</p><br /><p>I went far. Each time I stopped and put my feet down, I had gone about a hundred meters. Not bad! I still wished I could go without stopping at all, but what I am finally capable of today is more than I have ever been before. I reached the buoy and turned back. Yes, I did the full 750 meters. What a high! On the way back, I swam as slowly as I could, not trying to race, just trying to be as patient as possible. I felt each stroke, smooth and long, I breathed deeply and relaxed. I think if I practiced swimming that way I could really go forever. It's slow, but at least it's zen.</p><br /><p>When I got back to the shore, I couldn't believe that I had just done that, so I actually <em>went back out</em> and swam some more. I had to drill into my mind and my body that I actually did this thing, that I can believe in myself.</p><br /><p>Then I had a flat tire. Too bad! I had no air pump and all the bike shops were still closed. No one at the beach had any air pumps either. And to top it off, I happened to have forgotten my wallet today. So I called my aunt and got some money from her for the El. Sigh.</p><br /><p>Wow. These past few months of my life have been one eye-opening, mind-expanding experience after another. There is so much more I want to share, but a lot of it is private. I hate having to censor this blog, but given the audience, it is in everyone's best interest that I do.</p><br /><p>I think I'll be fine next weekend.</p><br /></p>
