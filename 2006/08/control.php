			<h2>Control</h2>
			<h3>23 August 2006  @ 20:06</h3>
			<p>My friend Marek says:</p><p><blockquote>i wonder whats gonna happen in 100 years<br /><br />with all the clones and cyborgs<br /><br />and cross species hybrids<br /></blockquote></p><p>Cyborgs, really?</p><p><blockquote>yeah sure<br /><br />definitely<br /><br />computers just add mumbers together<br /><br />and have on and off switches<br /><br />kind of like our brains<br /><br />you've studied neuro stuff<br /></blockquote></p><p>True, I have. But I'm not quite sure what the point of creating cyborgs would be. It only seems to be excessive technological exhibitionism. It would be more worth our whiles to learn to refine mental and physical control over ourselves. That meditation and control take years to develop turns most people away from it, but there are ways to induce it quickly. I don't have access to some of these ways, but it certainly would be nice.</p><p>One: Ayahuasca. [<a href="http://www.biopark.org/ayahuasca.html">a view from within</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca">a view from without</a>] Yes, I know. Sounds hippie, right? Well, I've read some pretty interesting experiential reports and I'm far from thinking that, with the right Shaman guiding the experience, it could not open up deeply entrenched psycho-spiritual blockages that prevent us from controlling our minds. You certainly can't be lazy when you do ayahuasca, but if you want to move quickly through these mental problems, it is one way. Anyone want to take me to Peru?</p><p>Two: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_mushrooms">Mushrooms </a> (and perhaps other psychedelic drugs). Again, I'm not speaking from experience, since I have not done any drugs in my lifetime so far. (Personally I feel that my mind is too underdeveloped still to gain maximum benefit from them.) If you are in tune with your mind, and if you can hold your awareness still for at least twelve hours, you could see pretty deeply into your mind through this psychedelic experience. It's as if your judgment (greed, aversion, indifference) is heightened to the point where it changes the way things appear to you. Some people can't handle it, because usually they suppress their real feelings, or do not care to explore their minds. If you are ready to face yourself, this could be interesting to try.</p><p>Three: Brainwave-matched drones. According to <a href="http://www.bwgen.com/theory.htm">this site</a>, apparently:<br /><blockquote>If external stimulus is applied to the brain, it becomes possible to entrain the brain frequency from one stage to another. For example, if a person is in beta stage (highly alert) and a stimulus of 10Hz is applied to his/her brain for some time, the brain frequency is likely to change towards the applied stimulus. The effect will be relaxing to the person. This phenomenon is also called <em>frequency following response</em>.</blockquote></p><p>Pretty cool, huh? The Peruvians knew about this centuries before. (What a fascinating people!) They created what are now called Heimholtz Resonators that coax your brain into whatever frequency will enable your mind to achieve alternate states of consciousness.</p><p><em>Edit:</em><br />Look! I just created a binaural beat frequency sound <em>[taken offline due to errors--see next post for sounds!]</em> in about half a minute. Download the .mp3 and listen to it on headphones. The tone in the left ear is 510 hz, the right is 500 hz. Together the brain perceives the 10 hz <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/beat.html">beat</a> difference. If you read about <a href="http://www.bwgen.com/theory.htm">brainwave generator theory</a>, you'll see that the brain at 10 hz is in the Alpha-wave state, "relaxed but alert." Does it work? I don't have my earphones with me right now, but I will try it when I go home.</p><p>I want to get my brain to the Theta state, and then I will only need half an hour of sleep a night. Cool!</p><p>There are probably many other ways to induce altered consciousness states (in healthy, non-debilitating ways), but these are my favorite so far. Eventually, I think you can become used to the altered state, and finally be able to drop into it without external stimuli. That would be one step closer to control.</p>
