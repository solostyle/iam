			<h2>Trial 2</h2>
			<h3>21 August 2006  @ 11:18</h3>
			<p><p>The important stuff first: Swimming in the lake again this morning went very well! I woke up at 4, but snoozed until 4:20. Left for the lake at 5, got there, locked up, started swimming at around 5:50, 15 minutes before sunrise. Waded in the water for several minutes, catching my breath, steadying my mind, mustering up the courage for the first full-body immersion. Dunked under the surface two or three times. Slinked under and began swimming. Ah, the water was so calm and lovely. Just the perfect temperature. I could see much less clearly than last time (Saturday), and I had to stop a few times out of fear. I talked aloud to myself, "it's all in your head, there's nothing in the water but water. You're fine. This water is easy." And how lovely it is to see not with the eyes but with the mind, and with every bit of skin! Deprived of vision, I now could feel how my body moved, how the water moved around it. I could feel the swells push me in different directions, another of my fears; but this time I saw it all as if it were a movie. It was happening to me, yes, but it was also just an element of reality. I was experiencing water.</p><br /><p>"I'll swim to the next orange ladder before stopping," was my motto, but during the first 200 or 300 meters, fear of the strangest things kept stopping me. I would swim amidst fear, and then after some time, I would notice that I was tense, not enjoying the swim, and running out of breath. I must have stopped about 6 times, when I should have only stopped 3 (once every ladder).</p><br /><p>"But that's okay," I thought, "this is still better than before. This is how long progress takes." I reached the first buoy at the 300 meter mark. I turned back. This time, I swam without stopping for what seemed like a long time. In fact on the way back, I only stopped once!</p><br /><p>I talked to a fellow in the water after I finished, and got some new ideas. After I expressed to him my fears about not being able to feel the bottom during the real deal (no standing possible, unless you're 10 feet tall), he suggested trying swimming beyond the first buoy to the second buoy where the water is around 10 feet deep. He says even now when he gets out there sometimes he freaks out that he can't feel the bottom. But that's all psychological. He knows he can swim the distance without having to stop. The fear eats up your energy very quickly, so it's important to curb that. "When is your triathlon?" I replied, "Sunday." He laughed and said, "Oh ho! Well, you better swim everyday then. I'll see you here again tomorrow."</p><br /><p>And so it will be. It's funny how I keep letting other people decide things for me. I am not usually like this. But somehow, these complete strangers have so much power over me. If my friends told me the same thing, I would shrug it off and "think for myself."</p><br /><p>But really, swimming out to a place of fear and forcing myself to be calm is the best way to train for the real deal. Now I know I can swim the distance in the lake. The rest is just psychological, just as Lisa said.</p><br /><p>It's Monday. Six days until <em>the day</em>, and I'm still improving. I planned this week to be my "give-up" week where I just rest and eat a lot. I was supposed to rest yesterday but ended up biking 15 miles, just to buy bike-related gear and food. I'm definitely getting a lot of biking and now swimming practice. There was a period of two or three weeks at the end of July and the beginning of August when I was only running. Sum totaled, I think I've inadvertently been training for the triathlon pretty well, which is what I had hoped for in the beginning. I realized last year that doing a triathlon would be perfect because I already swim, bike, and run off and on for amusement anyway.</p><br /><p>If I had been solid about doing the tri all along, I might have "trained" consciously and perhaps better, but I think what I've ended up doing is okay given that this is my first tri anyway.</p></p>
