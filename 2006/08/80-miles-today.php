			<h2>80 miles today</h2>
			<h3>05 August 2006  @ 19:29</h3>
			<p><p>Ride details:</p><br /><ul><br /><li><em>Riding time:</em> 6 hours, minus about half an hour, probably, for all the times I asked for directions along the way.</li><br /><li><em>Route:</em> Here's the <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=344098">route</a> mapped on gmap-pedometer, but I didn't bother completing the round trip. I rode up the Green Bay Trail to Lake Forest, caught up with the Robert McClory Trail, and took that all the way up to Zion, about 2 miles from the border.</li><br /><li><em>Average speed:</em> 13-15 mph, including stops for traffic, phone calls, and getting lost. Notice I didn't map out the times I got lost, because I don't know where I was. I wonder how many miles I spent doing that.</li><br /><li><em>Max Speed:</em> over 20 mph, especially on the way back. The terrain gets slightly more uphill going north from here, which I didn't realize until I was on the way back--it seemed too easy.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>And the funny thing is, my left knee hurts, not my right. Am I using my left leg more than the right? I hope not. I need to make sure both are being used equally! Now I will have to train to make my right leg more active, by trying to pedal only with the right leg for a few miles at a time.</p></p>
