			<h2>Treatment plan</h2>
			<h3>04 August 2006  @ 18:21</h3>
			<p><p>The good news is that I might be able to get the dental work done within a year's time rather than two. The bad news is, if there isn't enough space for the implants as it looks now, I will have to undergo two and a half years of dental treatment. The good thing about such a long treatment is that I will probably have perfect teeth by the time it's over. But I don't need perfect teeth. My teeth are not in terrible shape right now. Next week I will find out whether or not the dental implants will fit.</p><br /><p>I rode the train to Waukegan from Rogers Park, like last time, and took a bus to the office. On the way back, there was no bus, and I only had half an hour to get to the train station which was 3.2 miles away. So with my messenger bag and all, I ran for as much as the way as I could. That was fun. Normally, pre-injury and such, I would do such things on a regular basis.</p><br /><p>In other news, my sister's knee is giving her trouble again. She banged it accidentally against a car door a few years ago, and ever since then, it's been bothersome. She's a runner, too, and religious like me as well. She runs through the pain and everything. But lately, it's been acting up, and she got another MRI recently. Apparently, she has to lay off for a couple of weeks. I know that's frustrating. But if there's a chance it will heal completely, you might as well lay off for the few weeks it takes.</p><br /><p>Both of our injuries involved cars, and both are not sports-related but prevent us from doing our sport. It's like a battle between man and nature, civilization and raw human power.</p></p>
