			<h2>Despite barriers</h2>

			<p><p>Before I talk about this, I must say, I'm eating this delicious stir fry that the cook set on FIRE. It was on FIRE. For several seconds. The flames almost reached the ceiling. I felt so special. Mine was the only one that did that. And now I'm eating this fired food. So delicious! I'm now going to say that in line when they ask me what they can get me. "Ah, yes, some brocolli, pineapples, bamboo shoots, and a bit of fire, too, please." "Excuse me, ma'am?" "FIRE, dammit, give me FIRE!!!"</p><br /><p>Is it just part of physical and psychological training that menstruation has to be painful? Well, okay, I certainly haven't had the kind of cramps that some women get, at least not every time. Only twice was it so horrible that I had to take medication--once in high school, and once in college. Some women take it every time, and they don't find much relief. But the kind of pain that I feel is this gnawing, ever-present, bloatedness that makes the nerves in my abdomen and legs feel tingly and spastic. It makes me want to curl up into a ball and disappear. Or at least I end up not being very productive that day because I can't focus.</p><br /><p>But I hate giving into this forced unproductivity because, as a gender-equalist, I feel that it's one of those things that justifies paying women less for the same work that men do. Paying women less is like saying, "Okay, we know you people have your . . . problems, but we understand, so just work as much as you can. Oh, and we'll still pay you." Lame. So instead I research different solutions to this annoying involuntary muscle cramping problem and keep plowing through.</p><br /><p>It always makes me feel like eating nothing--and last night, when I was still unaware that the dreaded period day was approaching, I thought I had no appetite because I was merely depressed (which made me depressed). If I had known, I would have pushed away all negative thoughts and labeled them as PMS. But the sneaky thing about PMS is that if you aren't aware that you have it, you can start taking all its psychological aspects seriously. It takes years of practice in self-control to identify what's real and what's PMS and how to shuffle it off.</p><br /><p>So that's why I'm eating this stir fry. I wasn't hungry (and had no appetite), but I know that's all in my head, and things like vegetables, calcium, and whole grains really help. I was two breaths away from taking the bus back home to crawl back into bed!</p><br /><p>So after yesterday's magnificent day (which Toney told me this morning went up to 103 F!), I culminated it with an equally magnificent night. I rode some twenty miles or so, as fast as the crowded path would allow. At 10 or 11 pm, throngs of people lingered by the water. I saw a guy wearing all black with some crazy hairdo and a sharp black beard listening to headphones and drumming along feverishly on the concrete, with actual drumsticks. As if he came out there just to practice! I saw someone from the Rat Patrol on a tall bike (two bike frames welded together, one on top of the other). I saw many people jogging or rollerblading. And of course, crazy bikers who can't keep a straight line, ride on the wrong side, and don't look up at oncoming traffic. It was great fun! After my ride I did handstands on the sand by the beach and tried walking on my hands.</p><br /><p>I didn't sleep much last night, but I went running with Toney for the second time, this morning. Okay, so we ran faster than before, and I got tired more quickly, but I thought that was only because of lack of sleep. Then she asked me how much I ate yesterday. Ah, of course. I was low on energy, even though I drank a lot of electrolyte-infused liquids. After I came to school, I realized (in a kind of embarrasing way) that I'm on my period. *Sigh* And on a day when I decide to go free! Thank goodness for 25-cent tampons! (And penetrable hymens!)</p></p>
