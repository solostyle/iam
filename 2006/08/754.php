			<h2>754</h2>
			<h3>26 August 2006  @ 06:43</h3>
			<p>I feel so special with these big black numbers on me! I got bodymarked yesterday at the Expo: my race number, 754, on my right and left arms and right thigh; my wave number, 4, on the right calf.</p><p>I learned a good deal at the Expo, and I feel like I know exactly what I need to do at each stage. Most of the people in my wave are males--under 19, between 20 and 25, and between 50 and 54. There are also some females 20-24. I'm not sure how it's broken down. This is a bit comforting because it means I won't have to tread water for too long at the swim start. I'm in the "elite age group." Most of those guys are tall and fast and will speed away like rockets.</p><p>Anyway, I'm not "racing." Even seasoned racers don't really race. It's better to just race with yourself, even if other people provide encouragement. For me, I think the test is with my mind. It's like a really long meditation session with many parts, in the midst of thousands of new people, sounds, and smells. I think the novelty will be the most stark. But in the end, it's about how well I can stay with my mind.</p>
