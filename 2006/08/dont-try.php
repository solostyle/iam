			<h2>Don't try</h2>

			<p>Sigh.</p><p>This morning was a trip. I swam out to the first buoy where the water was shallow. Halfway from there to the second buoy the water is deep and choppy. So choppy that it's hard even to tread water. The fear and treading water for a long time make you really tired. I mean exhausted. It felt like all my energy was just completely sapped from me. </p><p>The guy I met last time--I saw him standing around at the first buoy and said hello. I was on my way back but he said he would swim with me out to the second buoy. I agreed, even though I was nervous. So we began. Swimming with someone in open water is strange. I don't think I've ever really done anything like it before. </p><p>We reached the midway point between the buoys. I stopped. And panicked. And swam to the sidewall as fast as I could, gulping water along the way. It must have looked comical. I clung to the ladder. Oh, the chagrin!</p><p>We headed back from there, but after a few strokes, I could see the rocks below me and the water was choppy and I was getting tired, so again I floundered my way to the wall and clung to a different ladder. Now I knew I could do it even though I was afraid.</p><p>The only thing I feared now was tiredness, not being able to complete the full distance back. It was more than half a mile back. The second buoy was half a mile from the shore. So basically I swam almost a mile in open water today. </p><p>I still did much better today than ever before, which I feel thrilled about. But is it enough? Can I rest all day tomorrow and believe that Sunday, everything will fall into place, and I will be able to face my fears? Last month fear stressed me out to the point of believing I couldn't do it. Now I am still afraid, but I believe I might be able to do it. But per the words of Bukowski, I have to not try, but do.</p>
