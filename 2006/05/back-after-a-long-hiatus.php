			<h2>Back after a long hiatus</h2>
			<h3>18 May 2006  @ 08:44</h3>
			<p><p class="post">Please don't shoot me. I haven't written for two reasons: Things have happened in the past month that are pretty personal, and the fact that more code needs to be written to make this blog work perfectly makes writing here unappealing. I will try not to procrastinate.</p><p>But I write now because if I wait too long, there will be way too much to update! I believe that what makes a blog worth reading by an audience and worth writing for my sake is honesty and openness, if not to a greater degree than you would find meeting me in person, then at least to the same degree.</p><p>I've hesitated to write (and still do at times) because of two personal things that I did not feel comfortable divulging in a public arena, and a few other personal things that I don't mind divulging but which are heavily emotional.</p><p>Of the two things I don't feel comfortable sharing, one I have decided to share. I've decided that if word gets out and my parents find out, either by reading this themselves or through other people who read it and then tell them, I'm willing to face the music. Especially because it is not shameful (quite the opposite, though most people wouldn't think so) and I seem to have made a mini-(really mini)-career out of it.</p><p>First, I've been modeling. I started freqenting a place called Helios (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=411+westheimer,+houston,+tx&om=1">map</a>) where they have nude modeling sessions for figure drawing practice. Artists come and go, it's pretty informal. My first time there, I had no other plans other than to maybe draw. I usually keep plans completely open when I go to a new place so that I can really see what's there. It just so happened that I talked to a few people there about modeling, and decided to try it a bit alongside <a href="http://elephantsafari.blogspot.com">Bobby</a>, the professional model (who models all over the city, apparently). Now I'm kind of a prankster and a rebel and the idea of having people draw an asymmetric body beaten up by a car crash, surgery, and atrophy struck me as wry and appealed to my sardonic desire. I've always had the impression, from various figure drawing sessions, that models ought to be beautiful and sleek, or if not sleek, at least powerful and confident. Even though I'm shy, I don't lack confidence, but I certainly don't see myself as powerful or beautiful. I think people rarely feel that way about themselves. In any case, I capitalized on these imperfections by getting some inner satisfaction (yes, I am a bit twisted, why don't we just let the truth out).</p><p>The next time, I modeled again for a little while, but on my own, getting more experience with how that feels. My reasoning was this: that Helios' informal atmosphere makes it ideal for newbies, admission is free if you model, they need models, and it's run by volunteers.</p><p>Bobby, bless his heart, thought I was so great he got me in at a <a href="http://scs.rice.edu/NccCourseView.asp?Mode=View&clCourseID=485&clSessionID=1213&SnID=1874485064&csCategory=&csFrom=&csTo=&csKeyWord=art&csSortBy=3&clPageNumber=1">Rice University Continuing Studies Figure Drawing Class</a>. Pretty amazing, eh? We modeled together for six hours, and they weren't going to pay me separately (Bobby and I would have had to split the pay), but the students (bless their lovely souls) chipped in and paid me more than I expected. As much as I like to model, it certainly feels good to get paid!</p><p>Bobby, bless his heart again, referred me to a guy at this place called <a href="http://www.arteryhouston.org">the Artery</a>, where they actually also have Carnatic music nights (impressive!). Anyway, the director of the modeling sessions, very professional, gracious, and respectful, agreed to have me model for an hour during his three hour sessions. And so I modeled last night. Helios is a pretty snazzy joint, but the Artery is like an art piece all by itself. Cozy, picturesque, delicious. The poses were long and tiring, but the man held his hand out to help me down off the stage every time. I felt regal. The pay hardly mattered to me; I felt completely compensated from respect.</p><p>So I'm booked again at the Artery in the near future.</p><p>I will update again about other personal matters, even if emotional. Must go to cycling!</p></p>
