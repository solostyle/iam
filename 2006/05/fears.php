I should make a list of things I will never like. It would certainly make things feel more solid.</p><br /><p>What am I so afraid of all the time, anyway? So many things. My mind races. I awoke with fear and a disinclination to get out of bed. I feel better now that I've quelled a few concerns. I miss the ocean. Sometimes it feels so foreign and fickle, and sometimes I find it to be the truest reflection of every thought and feeling. Words don't seem to work today.</p></p>
