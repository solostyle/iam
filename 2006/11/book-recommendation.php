			<p>Everyone should read this book. <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/feature/1999/12/08/warner/index.html">The Trouble With Normal:</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Normal-Politics-Ethics-Queer/dp/0674004418">Sex, Politics, and the Ethics of Queer Life</a> by Michael Warner. It makes a great argument for unearthing the American disgust for sex, and it traces the stigma placed on any kind of sexual variance that has become so common now as to be invisible. I'm reading it for my history class, but this is more than a historical work. It is a social critique of our continuing attachment to normality, a false morality, and a fear of sexual autonomy.</p><p>It came out 6 or 7 years ago, but it's still relevant today, and excellently written. Read it!</p>
