			<p>my aching chest</p><p>the wind<br />a constant 30 miles per hour. all last night and even now. the forecast says it will die down to 20 by the end of the day. i could hear the rush and the moan all night. how much stamina is has! it hasn't died down for a whole day.</p><p>a miraculous force of nature. does it reflect the stamina of human nature? or does it test it? to endure the wind is to be like the wind, to express its power.</p><p>i see a flock of geese flying against it. how do they do it? and with such grace and speed!</p><p>i sit here and listen to russian, german, japanese, english, korean banter. all languages sound the same in this context. the rise and fall, the attitude, the interruptions, the jokes. i understand without understanding. knowing one language is quite enough.</p><p>my fingertips are dry. peeling. i remind myself not to pick. my nails are long enough to help me forget my resolve.</p><p>my arms and shoulders quiver with fatigue.</p><p>i notice my posture and sit up straighter, adjust the screen of my laptop, let my chin relax upward, taking the strain off the spinal discs.</p><p>class starts in 8 minutes. when i brave the wind i feel like i know something.</p>
