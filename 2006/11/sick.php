			<h2>Sick</h2>
			<h3>02 November 2006  @ 09:25</h3>
			<p>Yes, I'm sick of it. I'm sick of not only what actually causes the initial loathing, but also the loathing itself. I will say one thing, however: last night I discovered that screaming can be a wonderful release, but somehow its effectiveness reaches its potential only when you feel that screaming would be inappropriate. Otherwise, there's just nothing really at stake.</p><p>Last night I felt like falling asleep in the tub with hot water pouring all over me. I was tired. I was sick of living. I'm sick of trying to live. I feel like I'm not actually living at all. During the day, I get distracted.. every so often, the image of just crawling into a hole and curling up into a ball and disappearing forever flashes in my mind. When will I get to rest? When can I ever rest? And I mean indefinitely. No time limits or space limits, nothing.. Just complete and utter silence and inertia.</p><p>I can't say it. I feel like it just can't be put into words.</p>
