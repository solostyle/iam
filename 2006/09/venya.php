			<h2>Venya</h2>
			<h3>16 September 2006  @ 13:39</h3>
			<p>Sheesh. I need a break from this novel. I just came up with a new perspective on it, and now I need some time to let it sink in. I'm not sure how to incorporate it, or if incorporating it will work. I remember freshman year I came up with multiple ways of interpreting Kafka's Before the Law, which my professor loved. It esteemed me in his eyes. But when writing a paper, it may be better to just choose one and go with it. I can't, though. It isn't true to me. Who cares? I can write a paper the way I need to! Why should the form of the "paper" dictate its content? The content should come first, and the form should bend to its command. Why not speak of the relationship between Venya and the State as incompatible blaming the State first, and then blaming Venya, later? I could do that. That might make the issue richer. And anyway, that's how I feel, whether or not it makes a good paper.</p><p>Good. Now the problem is.. is the part that's Venya's fault caused by the State? Or is it something only found in Venya? Are most people not like Venya because they lack his intelligence? Where did he get his intelligence from? Was it internationalization? The State DID want to be more international, want to be part of the global community. So when the State opened up, people like Venya who love to drink up all that philosophy and art took advantage and did it. Venya has great beautiful thoughts and ideas, you can tell by the way he talks about his beautiful heart and yearns for salvation and oneness with the divine; but he got disillusioned by the state of the Soviet Union as it crumbled under its false idealisms. That's why his intelligence has become a hubris. In order to come to some stable place, a home, he needs to believe in the journey, that the journey will lead to a brighter tomorrow. But he knows it cannot happen, the train just goes around and comes back where it started. That's the tragedy. It's a combination of his intelligence and the poorly-executed ideals of the State.</p>
