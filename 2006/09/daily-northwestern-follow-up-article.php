			<h2>Daily Northwestern follow-up article</h2>
			<h3>22 September 2006  @ 13:07</h3>
			<p>I was interviewed two days ago by Diana Xiu at the <a href="http://www.dailynorthwestern.com">Daily</a> about the accident and my state of affairs lately. It's a good article. <a href="http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/news/2006/09/22/City/Accident.Victim.Back.At.Nu-2303386.shtml">Accident Victim Back at NU</a>. Some of my quotes are a bit hard to understand, like the one where I was talking about my goals and circumstances. To elaborate and clarify, what I meant was that whereas before my goal of doing the triathlon was not a big deal for me or for anyone, after the accident it changed from being a personal athletic goal to a tear-jerking statement about the power of recovery. Or something like that. I'm much more eloquent when I type than when I speak. </p><p>I started school this week, and things seem to be going all right. A lot of work, a lot of extra-curricular work, as well. I'm going to have my spine checked for nerve damage, for one thing. It seems like I might have some long-term effects of the accident that I hadn't felt before. Oftentimes after a big physical trauma, it takes a few years for the pain to take effect.</p><p>In a few years, who knows what else will fall apart, go wrong, etc. Sometimes I feel abandoned by the universe, as if it left me here alive to suffer. Really, it's all suffering, even the good times are suffering because of how they appear in contrast to bad times. And other times, I feel like somehow I was chosen (just as each person is chosen) to take on a different kind of challenge, whether or not I am prepared for it.</p><p>Thinking about it makes me feel too heavy to keep writing.</p><p></p>
