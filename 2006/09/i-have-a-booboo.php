			<h2>I have a booboo</h2>
			<h3>30 September 2006  @ 20:33</h3>
			<p>The pain in my foot has gotten so bad that I can barely walk without feeling pain. Interestingly, the pain actually moved. It's no longer at the spurs under the ball of my big toe, but actually right in the center of the balls of my foot, in the fleshy middle pad. I'm not going to run for a few weeks--not just one week, or half a week, but a few weeks. Maybe even a month. Instead, once I can walk comfortably again, I'm going to do Tai Chi, Chi Gung, and swim. </p><p>I swam five days last week and it seems to be going well. I'm getting over anxiety and fear of water a little each day, the better I get at flips, buoyancy, and recovery after a mistake.</p><p>The more I hang out with Rob, the more I am persuaded by his conservative view of the economics of the body. I feel more and more that doing a marathon is not something that I should do. It isn't even something that most people ought to do. It's certainly not anything I want to keep doing for the rest of my life. I don't think that with my current physical anatomy and ongoing injuries that it's something I should do in the near future. What I do want to keep doing for the rest of my life is running. If I ruin it for myself now, I'll never be able to keep it up for the rest of my life. I am starting to believe that the body has a limit, and I want to conserve everything that remains to extend athleticism far into the future.</p><p>Aw, my poor feet! I wish I could just feel normal again! No more pain!</p>
