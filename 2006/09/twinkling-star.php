			<h2>Twinkling star</h2>
			<h3>07 September 2006  @ 14:31</h3>
			<p>I'm bald as a cueball. I shall find a lad or lass with a photographing device so as to capture the lights and darks that fall upon my head now. Then I can compare them to the images from two (or so?) years ago.</p><p>The nerves and muscles undergo mild discomfort now and then. Lately the nerves in my right leg and foot have been feeling strange. Suddenly I feel twinges of sharp pain in my knee or on the skin of my leg. It goes away after a few minutes of massage. Who knows, maybe the massage doesn't actually help, and it just goes away on its own.</p><p>In any case lately, I have also been exercising way more, the way I did in Houston. This renewed surge of enthusiasm for physicality has made me more aware of my body. I spent a few minutes this morning just feeling my legs, amazed that they exist and work despite all that has happened. How beautiful and strange it all is.</p><p>Like right now, I can feel my entire body shake every time my heart beats. I feel like a heart, like my whole body is throbbing and beating. I don't look like it from afar, but I'm pulsating like a twinkling star.</p><p>The wind through my window is divine and earthly. When it touches my body it feels like a normal breeze, but when it caresses my head, it feels divine. I wonder if women who shave their legs feel the same thing when the wind blows. Or maybe nothing feels quite like a shaved head, minutes after being shorn.</p>
