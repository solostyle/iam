			<h2>I awoke this morning feeling</h2>
			<h3>28 September 2006  @ 07:25</h3>
			<p>lonely. It took me several long moments to come to accept writing that word. What is the nature of this loneliness? Is it something similar to or different from the kind that I felt in grade school? Since the past is all I can draw upon to analyze my own experience, that is what I must compare it to.</p><p>As with all emotions these days, this one differs from my grade school days in degree of self-loathing, self-consciousness, and impatience. Maybe I have less of these first two and more of the latter now because I'm in a transitional period of my life when there isn't much I can do to keep the feeling at bay. I also feel that no one who isn't going through this would understand.</p><p>I want to be so close to a friend as to be able to call her at any time or go to her place without prior notice and pour my heart out, my frustrations, my fears, my love, my dreams, everything, without shame or hesitation. This is different from any other kind of need that I have ever had. I am more mature now that I was in grade school; the issues facing my life are much more important: my recovery from this accident (both physical and emotional), my dreams for the future, my decisions for after graduation--I'm going through such an important time and there's no one that I can really depend on for support and guidance.</p><p>Friends really do affect me greatly, as I realized after talking to Paul on the phone the other day. He gave me his opinion about JET and that I shouldn't waste a few of the most important years of my life doing something that doesn't work me to my potential, even if it is in another country (or just because it's in another country). Hearing this has completely changed my mind about JET and now I'm convinced it would not be the best thing for me. Going to Japan later on some other terms, or going just for a few months at a time to work on farms--those options are less taxing on my life goals, and they may occur with a more lucrative opportunity.</p><p>If just one five-minute conversation can change me this much, I can only imagine what it would do to have a real friend here with me all the time with whom I can exchange counsel. Yes, but I don't want to "only imagine"; I want a friend. A <em>real</em> friend. I feel so lonely, and if nothing else, just being held sometimes and having someone to hold sometimes would be magical.</p>
