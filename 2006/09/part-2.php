			<h2>Part 2?</h2>
			<h3>04 September 2006  @ 16:34</h3>
			<p>So in this what I deem to be part two of recovery, I've completed a triathlon (although I should have been DNF'ed technically but the people who got DNF'ed DNF'ed themselves with their bad attitudes and my positive attitude just made everything golden for me), I seem to have built confidence in my physical abilities again, and I'm training for other things now.</p><p>First is a 5K race in Bucktown, the <a href="http://www.bucktown5k.com/raceinfo.asp">Bucktown 5K</a> on Sunday, October 8, 2006. I have about a month to prepare. My goal is to run it in 26:00, which is extremely reasonable if not downright slow. During the triathlon, I finished the 5K in 29:30, but that's actually my 7-mile pace (equivalent to an 11K). So, if I'm doing nothing that day but that race, I should be able to go much faster, maybe even faster than my goal of an 8:20 pace.</p><p>When I'm working at about 90% effort, I can run an 8:00 mile. During race day, I'll probably go faster (unless I'm injured). In a couple of years, I would really love to be able to do a 5K in 20:00!</p><p>Today I started my 5K training. I did a 15-minute warmup of easy jogging, then 4 x 400 meter sprints + 2 minute walk, and ended with a 10-minute light easy jog. Tomorrow will be an easy 5K run.</p>
