			<p><p class="dream"><br />yesterday was difficult<br /><br />but i was brave enough to talk to people<br /><br />i bought some great comics from comics revolution, only the best comics store in the world. they had the new vagabond and all the johnny (nny) the homicidal maniacs and i even got the book about squee.<br /><br />i parked myself at a coffeeshop where paul was working<br /><br />he gave me free tea<br /><br />i wanted to read the comics but all of a sudden i started crying.<br /><br />i had felt it coming all day.<br /><br />i was at a research study getting paid to participate in an experiment and i felt it then<br /><br />but of course i held it in<br /><br />i guess at the coffeeshop i couldn't hold it in any longer<br /><br />i hid myself in the bathroom with the light off and hid my melting face<br /><br />then someone tried to come in<br /><br />apparently the lock didn't work<br /><br />so i ran out and sat back down<br /><br />but it kept coming back<br /><br />and people were looking at me<br /><br />but i couldn't go home<br /><br />not like that<br /><br />what if i couldn't see while biking?<br /><br />and the bus didn't come until an hour later<br />but as i found out later that was not a good idea anyway<br /><br />so i had nothing else to do but call friends<br /><br />i got a hold of roopa<br /><br />it was great<br /><br />i felt hope and i knew everything would be fine<br /><br />but i still<br /><br />after we hung up<br /><br />i started crying again<br /><br />something was hurting much deeper than just trauma<br /><br />it was <br /><br />i needed to see a friend<br /><br />to talk to someone<br /><br />to feel special<br /><br />but in person<br /><br />and there was no one<br /><br />there never is anyone<br /><br />no one calls me back<br /><br />or so i felt<br /><br />then paul told me he had come by my apartment the night before and rang my number<br /><br />it's true i heard my phone ring two nights ago but it stopped and said "unknown"<br /><br />i figured it was an accident<br /><br />but it was him<br /><br />and he said he was glad i came in today<br /><br />i hated him<br /><br />(he didn't call me back)<br /><br />how dare people not call you back<br /><br />how much it sucks<br /><br />and how often i do it to other people<br /><br />but he did<br /><br />it's just that he got a new phone<br /><br />didn't have my number<br /><br />so he had come by my place<br /><br />it didn't quite register<br /><br />i just don't feel close to people<br /><br />unless i know them for a while<br /><br />or something<br /><br />i don't know how it works<br /></p><p><br /><br />i was embarrassed<br /><br />i had nothing to be embarrassed about<br /><br />i don't like being stared at<br /><br />but there was nowhere to go<br /><br />and my head hurt from holding it in<br /><br />i went to the bathroom again<br /><br />then it was late<br /><br />i left<br /><br />i took the bus<br /><br />i needed to get home and sleep early so i could get up early to swim in the lake this morning<br /><br />i sat on the bus<br /><br />the tears<br /><br />i felt eyes<br /><br />i pulled the cord<br /><br />"you want to get off <em>here?</em>"<br /><br />yes<br /><br />i stood on the sidewalk a while<br /><br /><br /><br />my worst fear was going back to ask paul to just keep me company because i felt lonely<br />but who else could i contact<br /><br />and i'm always up for a challenge<br /><br />biked recklessly through dark streets with no streetlights<br /><br />with no bike lights<br /><br />with my helmet tied around my bag strap<br /><br />yelled<br /><br />"hit me!"<br /><br />an insolent threat! not a request<br /><br />paul was sitting outside the vacant coffeeshop it was after close<br /><br />smoking<br /><br />a cigarette<br /><br />i sat beside him<br /><br />said nothing for a while<br /><br />another cigarette<br /><br />it is hard to talk to someone who doesn't know you<br /><br />but i think i can universalize my turmoil<br /><br />he understood<br /><br />kept saying "it will pass"<br /><br />i know that. duh<br /><br />i just<br /><br />wanted to talk to someone who could make me feel good<br /><br />who thinks i'm awesome even if i'm not<br /><br />it's not about the truth<br /><br />it's just about <br /><br /><br /><br />i don't know what it's about<br /><br /><br /><br />why can't i tell myself i'm awesome?<br /><br />because i know it isn't true.<br /><br />if someone else says it, it might be true<br /><br />why do i need to be awesome?<br /><br />it helps me love myself.<br /><br />someone loves me<br /><br />and then i don't need to love myself<br /><br />i don't need to try to <br /><br />i can just let it go<br /><br /><br /><br />is that bad?<br /><br /><br /><br />usually i don't care<br /><br />i don't consciously "love myself"<br /><br />i just exist and things be<br /><br /><br /><br />it's just that i hadn't felt any human contact in a while<br /><br />i said<br /><br />i can't call my friends everyday<br /><br />paul said<br /><br />why not?<br /><br />(they would get sick of me. they are too busy. they can't talk to me. there's nothing to talk about every day.)<br /><br />i only call them when it hurts so badly that i can't do anything else<br /><br />i'm pretty good at holding it in until then<br /><br />i think<br /><br /><br /><br />he told me a riddle<br /><br />i came up with a solution<br /><br />he shook my hand<br /><br />it was fun<br /><br />he swept<br /><br />he mopped<br /><br />he talked about dojos, martial arts, the owners of the coffeeshop<br /><br /><br /><br />we walked home<br /><br />he saved two dollars<br /><br />of course it took a long time<br /><br />my leg only hurt a twinge!<br /><br />that's a big improvement!<br /><br /><br /><br />it was nice<br /><br />we didn't talk too much<br /><br />he isn't annoying<br /><br />but i don't think it would have bothered me<br /><br />just being around someone was enough<br /><br /><br /><br />i'm glad i didn't go home right away<br /><br />even though i went to bed too late to get up at 4 this morning to swim<br /><br />that's okay.<br /><br />these things happen<br /><br />it's worth it to get through them<br /><br />rather than mope that i lost a precious morning swim<br /><br />which i never had to lose<br /><br />in the first place<br /><br />i make plans<br /><br />life makes itself<br /><br />and i'm the fool<br /><br />because i miss out on the moment<br /><br />when i think about these fantasy worlds<br /><br />no plans<br /><br />what am i doing tomorrow?<br /><br />nothing<br /><br />whatever<br /><br />everything<br /><br />all i know<br /><br />is that tomorrow<br /><br />things will happen<br /><br />i just hope i'm there when they do<br /></pre></p>
