			<p><p>. . . is all I have to update this blog. Since I got back to Chicago two days ago I've been walking around quite a bit. From the train station to the police department to pick up my mangled bike, helmet, and clothing. From the bus stop to the Japanese department to take my three-hour final exam with an empty stomach and teary eyes. From my apartment to Kevin's house to work on the lovely new <a href="http://www.surlybikes.com/crosscheck.html">surly cross-check</a>. From Carlos' apartment with the new fixed-fixed rear wheel, spoked, round, and true, to the train station with a stiff, aching right knee and a sore right ankle.</p><br /><p>I was already so sore from carrying my bags through the airport. The cab driver, claiming to have a bad back, didn't help me carry them. But after two nights of rest, my rigged-up blanket-bed between my bony condyles and the floor, I feel okay this morning.</p><br /><p>I'm nervous about riding my bike through city streets. I aim to get back into it, confident that I can handle traffic, but it may take a few months. First I have to trust my legs. I haven't been to the gym in several days now, which worries me because I need to be diligent about rehabilitation. Although walking is exercise, it isn't as good as squats or leg-presses.</p><br /><p>I just realized I have a lot of coursework left from the Winter Quarter. Juggling that and training should keep things interesting. When it hurts, it's difficult to stay positive and keep looking forward to the day when it won't hurt anymore. Tai Chi is helping me trust my body's ability to heal.</p></p>
