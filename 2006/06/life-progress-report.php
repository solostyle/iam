			<h2>Life Progress Report</h2>
			<h3>06 June 2006  @ 14:45</h3>
			<p><p>Having a private diary is nice, especially one that I created for myself. The code is secure now, so I know no one can break into any incriminating entries. The only way to do it is by knowing certain passwords. Luckily, also, the server where I'm hosted is set up so that no escaped characters, like the quote or backquote, can be entered into any form field. If it were allowed, anyone could run php code on my server through my website. While it is possible to register yourself as a dummy-user, you have no higher privilege than any visitor. </p><br /><p>I like writing here because I made it myself. It's even better than writing by hand in a journal that I bought from some bookstore. And less incriminating! It makes me want to burn every journal I've ever written in by hand.</p><br /><p>I'm chillin with some iced tea at this coffeehouse in Sugar Land. They have free wi-fi access and nice arm chairs. Sturdy tables. Good classic rock. Nice folks. Floor to ceiling windows.</p><br /><p>Life has been . . . educational lately. It's not the best descriptor. Perhaps simply describing would be better. I've decided to treat this past week as a course for which I received marks. The score is decided by taking certain factors into account: my state of mind after the lesson, the direct, palpable consequences of the event, and the future repercussions of my actions. Let's begin.</p><br /><h3>Self-control: A+</h3><br /><p>First a lesson on being nice. Since my last episode getting mad at Nick for stupid reasons, I haven't gotten upset to the point of compromising politeness. Nick and I decided that it was a lack of self-control that leads to my blowing up over silly things, since I do not actually mean anything I say.</p><br /><p>Yesterday my parents found a photograph of me hugging Nick topless. We had a discussion about it. I heard their opinion, they heard mine. We reached no overt agreement. During our ten-minute rendezvous I felt a little jittery but maintained complete composure. My hands didn't even shake.</p><br /><p>Kevin recently chewed me out for being impolite a few months ago when I told him I didn't want to go out with him. We might or might not have kissed in the hospital during those many lonely nights penetrated only by the company of his kindness (and that of other less frequent visitors). I felt pressured to be his girlfriend as a payment for his kindnesses and for engendering a new bike for me. When in the comfort of privacy and distance, from my room in Sugar Land, I divulged to him my true feelings, that there should only be friendship between us. He obviously wanted the hope that there could be more later, given time. I told him, there is no guarantee, but I should have said, simply, no. That may or may not have been even more impolite. In any case, I acknowledge that, since this happened before I made the self-control pact with myself, I very likely might have been impolite then.</p><br /><p>He told me some ridiculous thing: that It was okay to act as someone's special other, complete with all the frills of <a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/honorificabilitudinity.html">relationshipabilitudinity</a> , for a temporary period of time if it makes someone else feel better, makes it easier to heal.</p><br /><p class="dream">Aside: I would never want to be someone's temporary girlfriend, but to each his own. I mean, if it's not explicitly stated, is friendship also just a temporary thing you do for someone to help them heal? What? I can't buy that. I keep it simple. No hidden rules or underlying anything. He should have thanked me for being honest. I don't think I would want to get involved in a relationship with someone who does weird things like that anyway. Kevin and I just miss each other on so many levels.</p><br /><p>Whether or not it made it easier to heal, I can't say, but I think I would have felt better in general had I not felt pressured to pretend to be his girlfriend. I am glad I escaped when I did, even though it led to an uncomfortable conversation. So during Kevin's and my recent conversation, even in the face of weirdness, I listened to him, ridiculous or not, and didn't cause a row. Good job.</p><br /><h3>Understanding: B</h3><br /><p>I did only okay in this domain. I really do understand how people feel about things, but I still stand up for how I feel. I haven't figured out the best balance between these two aspects. When I felt disregarded by Nick when he didn't call to talk about plans, I overreacted. Nothing was really his fault. I realize now that most people don't call people back, it's not a crime, and I need to lay off. And sometimes you just don't feel like calling someone back. Big deal. Instead of expecting to be treated a certain way, I should chillax and just go with the flow. I said I wanted to "command respect" or something--yes, that would be nice. My sister seems to do it well, but actually I don't want to be that way. Increasingly, I think I get more out of life when things just happen based on who I am right now. Some changes are called for, like having self-control, but deliberately manipulating other people is too much. Other people are such beautiful universes on their own--sad, pathetic, magical, reflective. It's fine.</p><br /><p>Okay I don't really understand Kevin, and he has the strangest ideas about me. Sometimes I get hints of only slight disconnect, but most of the time, the disconnect is vast. In any case, all I can do is just let him be what he is and continue being what I am. Communication may or may not work out, but who cares. It's all for the better, either way.</p><br /><p>Anyone who grows up with their parents for as long as I have can't help but understand them. I know my parents can be sensible and listen to reason, which I love about them, but I also know that what views they have are staunch, immovable, impenetrable. Inside, I do understand how they feel about my choices, but that doesn't mean I change. We still talk about morality, an important topic, but even though they raised me, we differ on the definition.</p><br /><p>So, I understand other people, but I feel unresolved on how best to balance our differences.</p><br /><h3>Self-expression: B+/A</h3><br /><p>Not an A+ because I could do this better. I succeeded in holding my ground, a good thing. I succeeded in telling the truth. But even though I tried by best, neither Kevin nor my parents really understood me.</p><br /><p>I've been speaking to Eli and Kelly more frequently lately. Communication seems to effortless with them. I can be poetic and they read beyond my words to the real meaning. They're more literary. We're more kindred spirits, I suppose. It's more free, they appreciate me, and have made me believe in myself a great deal lately. My heros!</p></p>
