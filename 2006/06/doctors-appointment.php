			<h2>Doctor's appointment</h2>
			<h3>23 June 2006  @ 10:27</h3>
			<p><p>So this is cool. I get to see Dr. Tatch, the maxillofacial surgeon who put my face back together, at 2:15 pm today. I was considering riding up to 2504 Washington St. Waukegan, IL, from where I live (here's the driving <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&sll=42.009037,-87.66321&sspn=0.02264,0.040255&q=to+2504+washington+st,+waukegan,+il&ie=UTF8&om=1">route</a>) but then found that there's a Metra station about three miles east of the office (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=95+N+Spring+St,+Waukegan,+IL+60085+(Metra)+%4042.360966,-87.828975&daddr=2504+washington+st,+waukegan,+il&f=li&hl=en&dq=95+N+Spring+St+loc:+waukegan+il&cid=42363611,-87844722,12187537064323974648&ie=UTF8&ll=42.356958,-87.841272&spn=0.045032,0.080509&t=h&om=1">route</a>).</p><br /><p>I just called a bike shop right in that area that I looked up on Google (<a href="http://www.cygolite.com/3-Store-Locator/dealers/6-dealers.htm">Ctrl+F "waukegan"</a>). I asked the dude who answered what he thinks about biking on Washington St. Even though I zoomed in the most I possibly could on google maps, to see what kind of highway it looked like, I wanted a real biker to tell me his opinion. It was a good idea. I recommend it to any biker who is going to a new area and unsure about bike accessibility.</p><br /><p>Furthermore, Rich lives up there, and actually called him first to ask him about the speed limit and bikability of Washington St. But he didn't answer so I looked up the bike shop and talked to that guy first. But Rich called me back and I just found out that he lives two miles away from where I'll be getting my jaws inspected. We might get to hang out. I haven't seen him in maybe two years? Crazy.</p><br /><p>Soooo, here's my plan.</p><br /><ol><br /><li>Take the <a href="http://metrarail.com/Sched/cnw_n/cnwn.shtml#STATION">Metra Union Pacific North Line</a></li><br /><li>12:52 pm: Leave from Rogers Park</li> <br /><li>1:50 pm: Reach Waukegan</li><br /><li>Ride by bike from the station to 2504 Washington (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=95+N+Spring+St,+Waukegan,+IL+60085+(Metra)+%4042.360966,-87.828975&daddr=2504+washington+st,+waukegan,+il&f=li&hl=en&dq=95+N+Spring+St+loc:+waukegan+il&cid=42363611,-87844722,12187537064323974648&ie=UTF8&ll=42.356958,-87.841272&spn=0.045032,0.080509&t=h&om=1">route</a>)</li><br /><li>2:15 pm: Hopefully arrive at 2504 Washington</li><br /><li>3:00 - 4:00 pm: Leave for Rich's place (not showing route to respect privacy)</li><br /><li>Hang out with Rich</li><br /><li>4:10, 5:10, 6:12, 7:10, 8:10, 9:10, 10:40, or 11:55 pm: leave Waukegan</li><br /><li>5:07, 6:05, 7:07, 8:05, 9:05, 10:05, 11:35 pm, or 12:50 am: arrive in Rogers Park</li><br /></ol><br /><p>Tada! So I did my research, and I everything should work out well. No rain, today, either! What a beautiful day! 66 F, partly cloudy, 11 mph winds from the NE, 56% humidity. Muah!</p></p>
