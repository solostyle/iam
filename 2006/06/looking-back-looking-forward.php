			<h2>Looking back, looking forward</h2>

			<p><p>Last night I ran, not jogged, three miles! I noticed if I'm listening to someone talk, I can lose my right knee. I mean, I feel it give out. It feels something like falling off the side of a bridge, that sense of losing your balance and trying to regain control. By the end, though I was able to concentrate on running and on listening and chatting.</p><br /><p>The weather was magnificent! We ran through Lincoln Park where there's a swimming pool and a huge field with a playground and a volleyball net and running paths and enormous trees. What's more is that people were using all those resources and having fun. Children and adults dotted the place. It felt like such a nice community.</p><br /><p>After I came back a few people, Bill, Charlene, Glen, and Kathy (who I had met at community bike events), came and talked to me about my injury. Bill and I were just talking at first--he started out saying I looked like I had been running before from the way my stride looked. Then we shared injury stories and he said, "Wait, you're the one who got hit by the yellow hummer?" It was all over the news, he said.</p><br /><p>He was angry. He couldn't believe the "fucking" cops couldn't catch the person who hit me. Now, I haven't been angry in a while, and I still am not angry, but hearing him talk about it so fervently impressed me. I'm glad that people really do care, even if the police don't. He suggested suing the police for negligence, for not doing their job. Or hiring an attorney (I suggested private investigator). Charlene suggested the same. They asked if the police really told me exactly what they did. Bill asked if they went to GM and got a list of all the parts that would correspond to the damaged area of the hummer (if indeed it got damaged) that were shipped after the accident. They could even look for expedited shipments. Charlene and I kept tossing around whether or not the hummer would actually have gotten damaged, while Bill insisted that there had to be <em>some</em>thing, and an unbiased third-party who is trained to look for such things could find evidence.</p><br /><p>Phew. Opening this up again? It never did close. The effort it would take to hire the people to do this job, the money we'd have to shell out, the time, the uncertainty, the complete waste of summer and the rest of my senior year. Whatever. I am happier focusing on my body and healing and enjoying being active. It's true the asshole who hit me shouldn't be driving on the road but... ahh, what a beautiful day!</p><br /><p>So I met some nice folks at the fun run last night. I think I'll make it a point to do it every Monday evening. Maybe next week I won't ride so much that day so that I can run better.</p><br /><p>I was so dehydrated yesterday after biking that I wasn't sure about running. Luckily my body shaped up and I was finally good to go an hour before the run. That night in the wake of an overpowering exhaustion, I sat on my steps and stared out the window for a long time... until I awakened and decided to go to bed. My apartment's poor air circulation made the room so hot that I slept with an ice pack on my belly. I even woke up mid-sleep to change it out because it had gotten warm.</p><br /><p>This morning I didn't hear my alarm until fifteen minutes after it started. I swear if I had been slightly more conscious I wouldn't have gone for a ride this morning; it felt like I was on auto-pilot. Sometimes the thought occured to me, "oh, I rode yesterday, maybe I'm too tired today," but for some reason it came and went and I didn't entertain it further. So I did a short recovery bike (8 miles) and run (.5 miles?). </p><p>I'm pretty sure I can get back up to riding around 200 miles a week. If I do four 40 milers a week, like yesterday, and then commute around town another 20 miles, that's 200. That will make it easy to bike to Madison sometime this summer, perhaps after the triathlon, in early September. Two centuries are also coming up this summer, a faster one in July, and a slower one in August. Oh! And tomorrow's the race!</p></p>
