			<h2>Brave cold world</h2>
			<h3>28 June 2006  @ 10:43</h3>
			<p><p>I did it! I did IT! Yes, IT. I am one step closer to understanding what it takes to swim on race day.</p><br /><p>I woke up at 4 again, downed some oatmeal, yogurt, and an egg, packed my bag and rode down to the harbor at Ohio St. Buoys bobbed in the water expectantly. I took a moment to gaze at the water and the bright red sun hanging low over it but quickly disappearing into some hazy blue clouds. Other bikers were locking up near the beach. As I locked up I asked them if they were training for the triathlon. Grace and Amanda were training for the <a href="http://danskin.com/triathlon.html">Danskin Tri</a> next Sunday and this morning would be their first open water experience. Hm.. I thought that was a little ill-prepared, but I tend to over-prepare.</p><br /><p>They had biked down in their tri suits which are fit for both biking and swimming. I only brought my swimsuit in my bag, since I wasn't actually going to swim unless I really felt like it. There were no changing rooms or porter potties, of course, so I wrapped myself in a towel and changed. Not that I have a problem being naked in public, but I wasn't sure if other people would.</p><br /><p>Three other women came down and pinched their bodies into some mean-looking wetsuits. Two other swimmers were already in the water. So Grace and Amanda waded out into the water and I followed a few minutes later. They hadn't started swimming, so I caught up to them and encouraged them to dunk their whole bodies into the water at once. I counted to three. One, two, three! Dunk!</p><br /><p>Now, I don't think I have ever been in water that cold in my life. It was difficult to overcome the mental barrier--or should I say, self-preservation instinct--that one should not be in such cold water for any length of time, let alone half an hour of swimming. According to the <a href="http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/glcfs/">GLCFS</a> the surface water temperature was around 65 F. And according to <a href="http://members.aol.com/b3t2/penguins/lmrept99.htm">this fellow's report</a> it should get slightly warmer by late August.</p><br /><p>So I got the other two to plunge into the cold murky water and felt pretty brave about it. But the true test was... could I swim? Amanda was set on it; she just started swimming. Grace started and stopped frequently. I just kept walking and shivering. After a while my legs felt warm but my upper torso was still cold, so I just slowly immersed myself into the water until my whole body felt warm. Ah! Finally I could swim.</p><br /><p>. . .</p><br /><p>A bit. I think I might have done .25 miles total, but with several breaks. After a few minutes, I would just get tired or too excited. The excitement would cause tiredness. The water is so cold that any amount of excitement further tires you, but it probably helps you keep warm.</p><br /><p>As for the water itself, Ohio St Harbor is very shallow. There was no part of the entire stretch where I couldn't stand up when I needed to rest. The Monroe St Harbor will be too deep to stand in, but I should be okay with that in two months. The water was not too murky, but even though it was shallow, I could barely see the bottom. If I had perfect vision, I wouldn't need goggles, and I would probably be happier without them.</p><br /><p>I think it's pretty amazing that I swam in such cold water with no wetsuit--without even a <em>tri</em>-suit! Just a skimpy ol' speedo swimsuit that has no padding anywhere. I'm so excited now. If I can just get used to this water, no matter what the conditions or temperature, I should feel just fine come race day. Yesterday I was frightened about the whole thing, but now I have a much clearer understanding of what it takes.</p><br /><p>After getting used to Lake Michigan, there's one more step to take before I will feel competent: swimming around, under, or through other people.</p><br /><p>I biked back home after the swim, which was difficult but not terrible. The sky was dark and bright all at once, and far away over the lake, the clouds fell in prussian blue curtains with a shimmery golden hue painted behind it where the sky was clearer. The sun backlight these enormous dark clouds whose crests were white like the foam atop waves. It started to drizzle, big fat drops scattered everywhere, but not exactly a storm. After I reached my place and changed into running clothes, I could hear the rain beating down. A few minutes later, it ceased. Too bad, I wanted run in the rain. By the way, running after swimming and biking feels like your entire nervous system and the electrical impulses suddenly got rewired and you have to relearn how to use your body. Eesh.</p><br /><p>I am still so sore from yesterday's weight training. I probably should have rested today, but I didn't exactly train hard. It was more of a .. shall we say.. <span style="font-style:italic">tri</span>?</p><br /><p>Yeah, yeah, I know I've used that pun too many times. It's still fun, though.</p><br /><p>I don't think I'm going to follow any strict training regimen. I seem to work best treating every day like an adventure and doing what feels best, while keeping track of what I've done in the past. I'm not sure how it is for other athletes, but perhaps the seasoned don't have to think about it too much.</p><br /></p>
