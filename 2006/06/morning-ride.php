			<h2>Morning Ride</h2>
			<h3>19 June 2006  @ 09:20</h3>
			<p><p>I rode 40 miles this morning, and reached the end of the lakefront path for the first time. I ate decently yesterday but starved myself last night (I was at a cafe checking email, dying to go home). When I finally got home and cooked, I was so hungry that it upset my stomach. So I stayed up and watched Samurai Champloo until I felt better. When I woke up at 4:30 this morning I wondered if I had enough sugar in my muscles from yesterday to do a longer ride.</p><br /><p>A few sips of water and off I went. I rode much faster today, but I dont have a meter so I can't say exactly. I'm almost as fast as the roadies on the path; when they passed me, they weren't going that much faster than me and a few of them actually sort of slowed down after passing me, so I ended up passing them again. Huge improvement from my last ride!</p><br /><p>I'm still riding with only one clipless pedal. My new pedals are being shipped out today Priority, so I might get them by Wednesday, but most likely Thursday. That means I may not have them for the <a href=<br />"http://bikeforums.net/showpost.php?p=2621389&postcount=546">Relay around the Coyote</a> race. Sounds fun!</p><br /><p>I'm so hungry I have a slight headache. I guess I'll find out how well I've been eating the longer I keep up this exercise.</p></p>
