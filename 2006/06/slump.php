			<p><p>The race was last night but I didn't go. I still felt bummed from the past few days. Felt that I would be alone, that racers would be rash and unsafe, and if my knee gave out or something I would be screwed. I wanted to go running at least, but I was too paralyzed to do even that.</p><br /><p>Then finally like a beacon in the darkness, the first human touch in several days floated to me over the phone through Roopa's voice. She helped me realize the reason I've been so depressed lately. She said that she'd call and tell me how amazing and awesome I am whenever I need it. She even left me a message that I can listen to whenever I need a little encouragement and love. That's so wonderful. I think I really do need it now that I'm alone, and my closest friends are far away. And we don't talk much.</p><br /><p>The people here don't know anything about me or my progress. If I try to share things, they simply can't relate. I feel like no one really cares, not even the people I thought were my friends. I think you really have to see what it looks like from the beginning to get a sense of how life-changing this kind of thing is.</p><br /><p>So here I am back in Chicago, and everything is the same except for me. Roopa pointed out that this might be the biggest contributor to my depression--that instead of feeling progress, I feel regress. In Sugar Land it was all upward because I had nothing to compare myself to except what it was like in the hospital. Now I'm comparing myself to how I was before the crash. How come I couldn't see that? She pointed it out immediately! I thought, "Ah, so this is what friends are for!"</p><br /><p>She said she'd call me again today. I can't wait! It sure beats calling people who don't call you back!</p></p>
