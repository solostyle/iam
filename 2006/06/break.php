			<p><p>What is going on?</p></p><p><p>Is it just wanting to feel sorry for myself?</p></p><p><p>I'm torn between wanting to wrangle life, command and direct it, take charge and live for dreams. And doing nothing, letting everything wash over, hiding under my blanket, being unconscious.</p></p><p><p>I want to live like most people: taking everything for granted, not appreciating anything, loving friends casually, and making a big deal out of little things.</p></p><p><p>I wanted to die so many times yesterday.</p></p><p><p>I thought of maybe calling a friend, maybe it would distract me, make me stop weeping, but I didn't. I figured there would be nothing to talk about. I can just imagine having a friend near me. I wish I had a dog.</p></p><p><p>But I don't. This is my reality. It's strange and difficult.</p></p>
