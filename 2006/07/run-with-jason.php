			<h2>Run with Jason</h2>
			<h3>26 July 2006  @ 20:15</h3>
			<p><p>YAY!!!!!!!! I feel SOOOO great! I did over 6 miles today total!! But I'm still in considerable pain, and my muscles are not responding as quickly as they should.</p><br /><p>So Jason and I ran about 3.2 miles together. He was not even out of breath.. but I was trying really hard after about a mile. I thought it was due to being tired from running in the morning, but I had a good 12 hours to rest. So maybe it was because I did not eat enough today. I did try to load up on the vegetables, but it's hard to do that when you have to eat out all the time. So right now tonight I'm at the Heartland Cafe, and I'm going to order a ridiculous amount of vegetables in a salad. It's a huge $10 salad, which is really pricey, but I think I have good reasons to do this.</p><br /><ol><br /><li>I need green vegetables to clean out my system.</li><br /><li>That was a really bad mix that the DJ just did. Horrible. The beats didn't even match.</li><br /><li>Back on topic. I need the green vegetables for the B-vitamins to get my speed back up. B's get your nerves working more efficiently.</li><br /><li>I want to get faster, I want to be stronger, I want to run with these people so that they get tired because of me, not the other way around.</li><br /><li>Actually I just want to be a good enough runner to motivate other people rather than give them an easy time.</li><br /><li>If I'm going to run 6+ miles a day, I need more calories!! And I have a tendency to not buy enough food at the store.</li><br /></ol><br /><p>Keep looking up, Archana! You'll get faster and stronger! Never look back!</p></p>
