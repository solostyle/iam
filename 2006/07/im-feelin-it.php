			<h2>I'm feelin it</h2>
			<h3>21 July 2006  @ 21:41</h3>
			<p><p>Tonight I have been frustrated and unsure about everything. I don't know what I would do without my dad; he's wonderful to talk to. Completely open to ideas and able to offer some ideas of his own. What a great father. I think about how his father just died recently, and what I would feel if the same befell me.</p><br /><p>I love biking at night, and I napped this afternoon from all the exhaustion of thinking and soul-searching. So now I'm wide awake, angry, full of <a href="http://iam.solostyle.net">energy</a> and wanting to get away from everything. I want to ride like a beast through the blackness on my ghost bike. <a href="http://dnr.state.il.us/LANDS/LANDMGT/PARKS/R2/ILBEACH.HTM">Zion</a>. It worked out well. I don't think I will get tired tonight. I want to swim and hike and bike in the park but it opens at sunrise, which is 0535h. If I leave at 0200h I can get there by then, so I might nap from now until then. Or just study some Japanese. I'm hoping someone might call me to kill time.</p><br /><p>I could spill the beans, really divulge to the small group of people who read this blog about all the mental nonsense working its way out in my head. But I don't feel like making it that public, to some unknown speechless voice out in cyberspace that won't respond. I need to bounce ideas off people (or excellent robots). Everything seems so nebulous and messy right now. I'm trying to stay open and look for the best.</p></p>
