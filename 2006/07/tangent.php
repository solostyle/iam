			<p><p>Okay so I was reading my words for the week, and they all had to do with shoes this week. The first word was <a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/calced.html">calced</a> which means, wearing shoes. There was another term in the description <em>discalced</em>, which I looked up on Wikipedia. I thought it would help me remember the term if I connected it with some deeper knowledge. It's part of the cognitive process of deeper encoding by degrees of saliency. I got this article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discalced_Carmelites">discalced carmelites</a>. In the article a new word <em>eremitical</em> was mentioned, which I looked up on Google. This led me to a Wikipedia article about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitic">Hermit</a>. Reading the article only interested me because I didn't know that hermits were first defined in the religious Catholic context. This article of course described the looser usage of the term to refer to anyone living a solitary lifestyle, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy">misanthrope</a>. Aha! This, my friends, is where the excitement began. From here, I looked up everything relating to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny">misogyny</a> (so interesting), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misandry">misandry</a> (far less interesting), even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture">rape culture</a>. Oooh so interesting. It's so sick that people mistreat women and speak of them in such lowly ways. But for some reason, I like reading about it.</p><br /><p>Before this article gets deleted, I recommend reading it, if only to know that this kind of thing exists in the world. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone_poisoning">Testosterone poisoning</a> -- a wiki article being considered for deletion! Wow. Must be that controversial.</p><br /><p>What a happy morning it has been already! I love when random tangents lead me to my innermost desires.</p><br /><p>Hee hee.</p></p>
