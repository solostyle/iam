			<h2>The problem with my leg</h2>
			<h3>26 July 2006  @ 15:28</h3>
			<p><p>I just want to append: After my run this morning I tested my leg and discovered the weak area. If you <a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/2006/03/yay.html">go way back</a> to one of my entries from the earlier days of recovery, you'll see one of these exercises that I'm now having trouble with. I can't lift the right leg when I'm lying on my right side. It's called AROM Hip Add Sidelying. The adductors are damaged! Pooh.</p><br /><p>P.S. All the entries should be working now. I had an issue where the server couldn't republish entries due to a file open error. That should all be fixed now. All the entries should work!</p></p>
