			<h2>Quick update</h2>
			<h3>25 July 2006  @ 22:59</h3>
			<p><p>I'm sitting outside in the alley behind my apartment building, so I should make this quick. I don't see anyone around, but I live right next to a sketchy area... MORSE! Anyway I want to update on how things feel right now.</p><br /><p>So I ran this morning, on the treadmill, but still, I think I worked pretty hard. And still, when I sit down, I can't really lift my right leg because the ligaments are still sore. Earlier tonight Nick (the neighbor) and I went to the beach, and when I got out of the water, I had trouble walking again. It's so strange.. How is it that I can RUN but I can't WALK? What is this nonsense!?</p><br /><p>Tomorrow morning, I meet with Toney, this chick I found on <a href="http://craigslist.com">CL</a>, at 6:30 for a run. Then later tomorrow evening, around 6:00 or 6:15, I meet with Jason, who I also met on CL, for a run. They both live really close to me, and I want to run with someone. It seems like they're both pretty slow, though, so I wonder if it will work out. Wish me luck!</p></p>
