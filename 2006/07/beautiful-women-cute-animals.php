			<h2>Beautiful women, cute animals</h2>
			<h3>28 July 2006  @ 11:54</h3>
			<p><p>I notice that I've been ogling women lately. I'm not sure how it happened, but I find myself feeling so much pleasure and wonder to look at a pretty woman's face. When I catch myself doing it, I sometimes try to look at men instead to see if I feel similarly, but I don't. I can't look at most men for longer than a split second before getting bored. I still wonder if all women are pleasant to gaze upon or only some. So far, I have seen very few women that I don't find pleasant to look at.</p><br /><p>This morning I noticed one especially interesting face. She was an Asian woman probably in her third trimester wearing a black and white top (or was it an entire dress?) She looked refreshed and clear like a moon. She seemed to glow with some powerful inner peace. She was reading something.</p><br /><p>It's lovely that women can be so soft and gentle on the outside and yet so strong and fertile inside. I wonder what's going on in her body and brain. Is she making new neuronal connections? Is she through her pregnancy being reborn herself?</p><br /><p>I've also been taking pleasure in watching animals. I love the way squirrels jump across the grass with their tails making waves. They're so fluid and spontaneous. I live in an area where just about everyone seems to own a dog. And every time I see people with their dogs I dream about having one of my own someday. Once on my way back from the beach near my apartment there was a guy walking in front of me. He turned around and whistled, and from quite far away, a little white scottish terrier bolted toward him. When it saw me, it slowed down and started tracking my footsteps. I knew it was behind me but I didn't bother with it. Then I felt a cold welt lick on the inside of my leg. I jumped slightly and saw the little runt pass between my legs, look back at me once, and join its owner up ahead. I think I melted completely to the ground.</p></p>
