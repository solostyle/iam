			<h2>Run with Toney</h2>
			<h3>26 July 2006  @ 09:10</h3>
			<p><p>That was fun! I haven't run with anyone this good before. Once my leg heals from the pothole incident, I'll be able to run more regularly like the old days--but better because now I have a goal. We only did just a little over 3 miles, but we talked pretty much the whole way. I know I can go faster normally, and I could tell she could also go faster, but I'm glad she was patient with me.</p><br /><p>What a cool chick! She grew up in Russia, went to school in Oregon (badass!) and is now a dog-groomer in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgewater_%28Chicago%29">Edgewater</a>. In college she ran with the team, and they did a 1.5 - 2 hour training most days, with a lot of speed work. That's what I need to do! She got from a 10:00 minute mile to a 6:30 minute mile. What an immense improvement. It took me a few months to get from a 10:00 minute mile to a 8:30 minute mile, and I wasn't even working very hard. If I could train hard-core with someone, how much stronger I could be!</p><br /><p>But I can't keep up an 8:30 min/mile pace for much more than two miles. Toney did a half marathon in her college days at a 6:30 pace! How amazing. If I worked hard enough, could I do a full marathon at an 8:30 pace by mid-January? At this point, could I even complete a marathon? Possibly, but it might be painful.</p><br /><p>I was a little nervous about the run before we started because I was having trouble walking, and I hardly slept the night before due to sweating and intense dreams. But after a mile or so, I felt okay. I hope it lasts until tonight when I go running with Jason.</p></p>
