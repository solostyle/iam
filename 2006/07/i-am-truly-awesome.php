			<h2>I am truly awesome</h2>
			<h3>25 July 2006  @ 09:26</h3>
			<p><p>Yup. So for those of you who are reading this for the first time, know that this blog is all about how amazing I am, and what a thrill I get from unabashedly boasting about it.</p><br /><p>Hey, life is short, and if I were to weigh all the times that I've down-played my exploits against all the times that I've bragged, though hard to believe now, the scale would crash toward the side of self-castigation. It's true, I never feel that anything I do is good enough. Whether or not it is actually good enough doesn't matter--only what I feel matters. And today, I feel accomplished.</p><br /><p>I hit a pothole early Saturday morning around 3 am while <a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/2006/07/im-feelin-it.html">attempting to make it up to Zion</a>. It was on the side of the sidewalk that I was just climbing onto and filled with water. I thought it was just a shallow puddle, but it was actually so deep that when I pulled my bike out, the front wheel was half covered in mud. My right foot was on the front of the pedal stroke when I took the impact, sending the ligaments of my right hip all out of whack. I hobbled home, somehow climbed up the stairs with my bike, and went to bed.</p><br /><p>The next morning, I couldn't even stand up! I spent the entire day in my apartment watching Naruto, studying Japanese, and sleeping. On Sunday I was able to walk a little bit, and finally I left the apartment in the evening to go for a walk. Not exercising makes the body feel so sluggish and disgusting!</p><br /><p>Then yesterday, I was still limping and in pain but I felt like running so badly, what with the weather so fine and my spirit getting restless. I jogged about half a mile before I couldn't stand the pain anymore.</p><br /><p>Then this morning I decided to go to Spac to swim, at least I could do that much. But I forgot my goggles and swim cap! So I ended up running on the treadmill. And to my surprise, I ran 3 miles straight! The first two I ran at a 10min/mile pace, and then after a while, it didn't hurt anymore, so I upped it to my normal 8:30 pace. It was sweet!</p></p>
