			<h2>Like a Sea</h2>
			<h3>19 July 2006  @ 13:12</h3>
			<p><p>Recovery continues and will continue for the next several months. In fact 2006 will turn out to be the year of rest and recovery. I think I deserve it. I like to just laze around and let my mind wander. Recently I've been thinking about future plans, especially now that I've come to accept that I won't be able to work in Japan any time soon. It was a large pill to swallow, got stuck in my throat for a few days, but I think I've resigned myself to it now.</p></p><p><p>I met with Kouichi-san yesterday and mentioned it to him, ending it with something Nick said, but of course in English: &#26085;&#26412;&#12399;&#12356;&#12388;&#12418;&#12354;&#12426;&#12414;&#12377;&#12290;(Japan ain't going anywhere.)</p></p><p><p>The implication being that I <em>do</em> go places, my mind does wander, and where I will be in life two years from now may not allow me to go to Japan for work ever. Kouichi-san said: &#12391;&#12418;&#12381;&#12428;&#12418;&#33391;&#12356;&#12392;&#24605;&#12356;&#12414;&#12377;&#12424;&#12290;(But that's all right, too.) If the wind blows in some other direction, and that's better and more important at the time, then so be it. Some opportunities seem never to come at the right time, but if you look closely, others come at just the right time.</p></p><p><p>Like yesterday for instance. Yeah I was supposed to be swimming every day until the Waukegan tri, but after several repeated frustrating episodes of immobilizing trepidation (ooh, long words!), I was like, I ain't doin this no more!</p></p><p><p>But O, as chance would have it, curly-haired spirit queen Danielle called me, "Hey, we're at the beach right now, so if you wanna come, come." I came. We played around in the waves that crashed over our heads. What a day! I wonder if waves are larger after a storm, as it did storm day-before-yesterday, complete with crazy-ass lightning, like some God of Summer got tired of the fireworks that happen on the beach twice a week and unleashed his blinding powers to show us all...something.</p></p><p><p>And with the Goddess by my side I learned to dive under and through the waves with masterful bravery (certainly not skill). Anna-Marie said, "You don't seem afraid a-toll! You're very brave!" (she's from London). Aha!</p></p><p><p>But I know the fear still lurks within when I'm alone in the water on a rustling golden morning, inching forward into the unknown, ducking under roiling swells, anticipating a sharp drop every step. I am less afraid of waves now, but I'm still afraid of depth. I know the waves are not going to hurt me. If anything I'll get a nice blue gulp of dirty lake water and cough a few times. But I can float around or swim or do whatever I feel like.</p></p><p><p>Once I get out to the deeper water, the first thing I want to do is dive! I want to slink down through the rough surface and wiggle around in the dark, turn my head up to face the surface and watch the blue get bluer and bluer until I see sky. It's so beautiful in my dreams, and so frightening in real life. O but it will happen, I tell you now.</p></p><p><p>My shin is connected to the deltoid ligaments of the ankle. Of that I am now sure. Jumping in the lake and tossing with the waves made my right shin hurt a bit, and in turn, the deltoid ligaments as well. But this is good! New forces! New tensions! New passions! New splashuns!</p></p>
