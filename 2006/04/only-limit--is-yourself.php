			<h2>The only limit ... is yourself</h2>
			<h3>15 April 2006  @ 22:20</h3>
			<p><p>My new inspiration is <a href="http://www.zombo.com">ZomboCom</a>. It's true, the only limit to anything is yourself. I think I'm going to add it to my list of start web pages in Firefox (my browser of choice). If you didn't know, you can open multiple start pages at once, in tabs.</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.obmoz.com/obmoz.swf">OBMOZcom</a>, on the other hand, is a little depressing. Not as sugary sweet at all. In fact, a complete antithesis with an endless abyss of darkness. The guy can't even pronounce "obmoz" properly. I will not add this to my start pages list in Firefox.</p><br /><p>And anyway, ZomboCom's got a great funky Caribbean accent. How can you resist that?</p></p>
