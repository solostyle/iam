			<h2>Inner change, maybe</h2>
			<h3>15 April 2006  @ 23:54</h3>
			<p><p>I just realized a way in which I have genuinely changed (from my distant past). The way Tai Chi training pushes me probably has something to do with it. When I was younger I always had this idea that this life was special and that I would beat the game and attain "salvation" or "yogihood" or become a hermit in peace and silence eventually. I don't know what gave me this idea, but I always felt that path was the one for me. Now as I look back at my progression through life, I can't say I've done everything well. But whereas before, this realization would scare me, make me lose respect for my life, now, it makes me smile and burn brighter with the desire to try harder, even if it means hundreds and thousands of years of painful, chaotic life. Even if there is no "salvation" at last. I blaze on toward the dream (without deluding myself that it is real) because I <em>must</em>. I think I am wired that way. And attaining the dream is in the wonderful moments that make up life.</p><br /><p>How do I know there is something there to earn? Those conscious moments of my life are proof. I can feel the joy of biting into a pear, of watching the fiery ashen sky, of holding my friend's hand. There is so much joy in these things, that I want to clean my mind more and more to get to the purest form of joy.</p><br /><p>Yesterday, Randy, Jyoti, Nick and I went to more Fotofest exhibits, including <a href="http://www.alfredojaar.net">Alfredo Jaar's</a> the Sound of Silence (which I had been dying to see). Kevin Carter, a man who had seen pain for many years, said that the suffering and pain of life overrides the joy to the point that joy does not exist. He was haunted by memories of wounded and starving children. I try to imagine being haunted that way. Would I then gas myself to death?</p><br /><p>I just . . . don't want to believe that life may be horrible and joyless for so many people. I remember my bittersweet childhood with the conviction never to return to that kind of depression. I made a conscious decision seven years ago that I would transform my sadness into happiness and allow myself to revel in whatever my heart desired, unabashedly.</p><br /><p>Kevin. Kevin Carter. I am not Kevin Carter. But I want to reach his spirit somehow and send him fields of wildflowers, sunsets, pears, warm hands, whatever gives me joy, in the hopes that he'll feel it with me. Maybe he'd send me starving children, bombs, racism, whatever haunts him. I believe in the joy of life, to the point where pain does not exist. Or do I? Is it only because I am sheltered? And yet... how I wish I could feel the opposite for one moment, so as to understand Kevin Carter, and then to work it out. Would there still be joy? I told my friends that I wish what Kevin had been through had happened to me instead, not because I know Kevin and want to lessen his pain, but because I feel that I might be strong enough to absorb all that negativity and neutralize it with my positivity. No Kevin Carter would have had to gas himself.</p></p>
