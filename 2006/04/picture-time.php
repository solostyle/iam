			<h2>Picture time!</h2>
			<h3>15 April 2006  @ 21:32</h3>
			<p><p>People keep telling me they want to see more pictures! Well, I've changed the format of this page so that on the right you'll see a list of images and videos for your viewing pleasure. They're ordered by date. I think it might be better to host them all on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> but I've been distrustful lately of external web hosting (i.e. Blogger).</p><br /><p>So do you think my jaw is very different now from before? Compare before the crime:</p><br /><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/me_old.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/me_old_small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/me_old2.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/me_old2_small.jpg" /></a></p><br /><p>I know there is a very slight difference now, but it really is difficult to see, especially with pictures from the past that aren't exactly the same angle as the present ones. My chin has dropped slightly lower.</p><br /><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/me_sleepy.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/me_sleepy_small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/me_smile.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/me_smile_small.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/me_awake.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/me_awake_small.jpg" /></a>&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/profile.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/profile_small.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/quarter.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/quarter_small.jpg" /></a></p><br /><p>And I know you want to see my teeth really close up!</p><br /><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/teeth.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/teeth_small.jpg" /></a></p><br /><p>In the above picture, you'll notice the slight difference in the two sides of the jaw. I think they were pretty even before.</p><br /><p>The prosthodontist checked my bite last week and found that around where the canines are, the bite is a little weak, the teeth aren't flush when I bite down. The molars are pretty tight. The front teeth don't quite meet at all. Because the front part of the lower jaw is lower than it should be, the bottom lip completely covers the lower set of teeth when I smile. Usually you can see a bit of them. I wish I had an older picture of me smiling with my lips apart.</p><br /><p>Oh! Here's one with my beautiful sister (me, left; Aparna, right):</p><br /><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/me_and_apu.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/me_and_apu_small.jpg" /></a></p><br /><p>I guess my lower teeth don't normally show that much anyway. That makes me feel better!</p><br /><p>Now, I'm sure you want to see pictures of my room here in this townhome. I love busy rooms!</p><br /><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/room1.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/room1_small.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/room2.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/room2_small.jpg" /></a></p></p>
