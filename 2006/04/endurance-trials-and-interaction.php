			<h2>Endurance trials and Interaction</h2>
			<h3>18 April 2006  @ 23:30</h3>
			<p><p>I've been walking for about a week now, though not with every chance I get. The first five days, it was still quite a hobble. Saturday's walking adventure (yes, the 2.6 miler) revealed something about endurance that I hadn't expected. I was surprised that my knee actually got stiffer after walking for a while. It doesn't feel like the normal kind of strain that you get in the back of the knee, where the hamstrings meet the bone. It feels deeper, but still behind the knee, and the pain needles and radiates into the foot sometimes. I would liken it to carpal tunnel syndrome.</p><br /><p>I didn't start actually feeling the carpal tunnel aspects of it until Monday when Roopa, Benita (her friend) and I hit up FotoFest again. Luckily I was smart enough to bring a crutch along because I knew, from the day before, what my endurance limits were. By the end I felt myself actually wish for a wheelchair!</p><br /><p>But now I've learned a bit more about my knee from that experimentation. The therapist today said I might want to try Advil or Tylenol. I have the same gripes about those petty medications that I've always had: if they just numb you from pain, you're only making things worse with your continued behavior. So I would rather <em>know</em> what I'm doing to myself and stop rather than try to dull the pain and keep going. I don't get why the therapist told me this, but I think she meant it more for a situation that I couldn't avoid. I haven't had many of those lately, and when the knee starts hurting, I am all but forced to be immobile until it stops hurting.</p><br /><p>Putting weight through the leg has been straining the top of the foot, as I had mentioned before, but that particular pain feels more like it needs to be worked out. Like bubbles that need to be popped. The knee just starts screaming all of a sudden, making it hard to predict whether or not I will need a crutch for a particular stretch of time. So for the next week or so, I plan on re-incorporating it into my life.</p><br /><p>I should record myself walking again! The movement is very fluid early in the day when the knee and ankle are well-rested.</p><br /><p>My endurance has been lagging in other ways, as well. Last weekend, I didn't eat much because I didn't go to the gym. And I didn't go to the gym because I didn't want to worry my parents by taking the car out when they were still asleep (I go early). So I didn't eat much because I just don't get much of an appetite unless I'm active. When Monday rolled around and it was time for Power Cycling, I couldn't keep up with the cadence during the sprints toward the end. I must not have refueled enough over the weekend nutritionally.</p><br /><p>Master Swim this morning got kind of cut, which isn't a terrible thing, since I did my own drills later. I thought I was going to pick up a bike from Nick and work on it this afternoon at Third Ward Community Bike Shop, but I didn't know they were closed today. So I asked my Dad if I could keep the car, which meant driving him to the car pool place (where he meets up to go to work with other people from here), which happened to be just in the middle of Master Swim. And it turned out I didn't need the car anyway. I did learn something, though: that I enjoy driving, and that I can do my own drills pretty rigorously.</p><br /><p>I can't express how fascinating it is to me to swim back and forth in a lane, in my own world, counting laps, counting breaths, counting strokes, pushing, pulling, concentrating, trying, trying, trying! It's like playing with a new toy (the same one I was born with) every time, opening chambers that were locked up before in my shoulders, in my hips. Interacting with the water, which always keeps you in check: you can't be tense, and you can't be lax. When you push, it pushes back, but in its own way, and you have to keep listening to know how to respond. It's a conversation, it's a dance. WOw.. this just reminded me of what Nick and I talked about last weekend. We walked and talked about interaction and response. I was frustrated that it seemed like our friendship was not mutual, but my fears were based on what I see on the outside. I reached understanding, and I think I understand it and interaction in general even better now.</p><br /><p>There is no language for so many things that I sense. In movies and books, it always seems so well-planned, so perfect. They offer neat little categories to help you process things in real life, but I think I see so much that just amazes and confuses me that has no category.</p><br /><p>Tonight I went over to Randy's to where we played Donkey Kong Kountry and watched I <3 Huckabees'. He's leaving to California tomorrow, so I may not see him again for another five or so years. I just loved being with friends this past weekend! It's nice to cherish small moments. They're such great people.</p></p>
