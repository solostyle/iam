			<h2>Transcending inertia</h2>
			<h3>19 April 2006  @ 12:27</h3>
			<p><p>Yay! I'm so proud of myself this morning for finally breaking through this exhaustion. Usually I burst at the seams with energy. I felt the exhaustion again as we started up cycling out of the saddle. But then I noticed that the instructor was starting to sweat, too, so I figured that it was normal to feel a little tired. Usually I feel more energetic when I'm out of the saddle, at least at the beginning of the hour. Well, I stayed with the feeling today and reached a point where I felt things flush out. I hydrated throughout the ride, didn't slack off, and actually sprinted faster than usual.</p><br /><p>Then I came home and gorged!</p><br /><p>I think I need to up my mood a bit, too. I've been more sedate than usual. You see the orange on this website? That orange is where I need to be! Bright and loud!</p></p>
