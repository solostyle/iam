			<h2>Transcending time</h2>

			<p><p>Read this:</p><br /><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/ch950419.gif"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/ch950419_small.gif" /></a></p><br /><p>I do the same thing!! Except on much longer time scale, around 5-10 years. When I was in first grade, I wondered about being in twelfth grade because it felt so far away. And when I graduated I remembered this thought I had in first grade. Then I had chicken pox when I was six, and it left marks all over my body that wouldn't go away. My Dad said, "Wait five years." So when I was eleven, I looked, and the marks were still there. I resentfully showed my Dad, too. I wonder if he remembered.</p><br /><p>I made a few more mental time capsules like that. I currently have one open for when I'm thirty. That's a very important year for me, because Master Choi told me when I was twenty to work hard at Tai Chi so that in ten years I would be able to heal people. Yeah, right. And I also currently have one open for 44 years (when I'll be 66). I might as well open a bunch more up, since it seems to easy to do. Why be so selective? Because when you remember your past self, if you can accurately remember, it's a wonderful connection, and too special to overdo!</p></p>
