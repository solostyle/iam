			<p><p>Yesterday morning, I practiced handstands. I could do them pretty well, which in my language means as well as I used to. Then I got the idea that I should also still be able to drop into a  forward roll following the handstand. In the empty basketball court under the humming flourescent lights, i laid out a yoga mat with a foam pad on top and practiced forward rolls, to warm myself up to the idea. I then practiced handstands to the point where I could hold them pretty indefinitely, waiting for the moment when I would finally tuck into a roll. But it never came. Instead I would think about doing the forward roll and my handstand would break from all the hesitation. I became a bit frustrated and realized this hesitation was a mental block, not a physical one, because I could so easily do a forward roll and a handstand, but not together. I feared I would hurt myself. The whole point became trying to expell my fear. The last time I tried it, my handstand broke, I twisted and fell sharply on the toes of my right foot.</p><br /><p>Trying not to be too disappointed in myself, I limped to my shoes and crutches, put the shoes on and left the court. It was only later that I realized I had strained the toe just next to the little one. It felt similar to the kind of pain that would only go away if you could pop your toe, but I popped it to no avail. It was a deeper strain. So I promised myself not to do anything strenuous with the foot until the toe felt completely better. I've been happily crutching along the past two days again. I actually enjoy crutching around; it's quicker, it makes people act nicer (holding open doors) and brings out altruism, and strikes up conversations. I love talking to random people! I've been meeting so many interesting people with life stories to share.</p><br /><p>I am no longer impatient about healing. Every moment is enjoyable, but it always has been. When I was clouded by the bleak present, I couldn't see the beautiful future ahead. I would dream of it, trying to believe in it, but I also wanted to stay in the moment no matter how alluring thoughts of the future seemed. Now that the present is unclouded, I've been able to relax and enjoy it all. I drink in my days, the sun, the heat, the sky, the breeze, the noise. In the car today I turned on the radio, a rare act, and flipped through channels until I heard static, just noise, and stopped. I listened to this intently for the rest of the drive. It was much more interesting than the noise that people usually listen to on the radio. But nothing is better than silence.</p><br /><p>I will share some photos of the world that I took today.</p><br /><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/sky_light.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/sky_light_small.jpg"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/sky_trees.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/sky_trees_small.jpg"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/sky.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/sky_small.jpg"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/trash.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/trash_small.jpg"></a></p><br /><p>They capture how I felt tonight.</p><br /><p>I've been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4770019572/102-8727877-6165766?v=glance&n=283155">Musashi</a> by Eiji Yoshikawa. This was after reading interviews with Noam Chomsky in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080507967X/102-8727877-6165766?v=glance&n=283155">Imperial Ambitions</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4770019572/102-8727877-6165766?v=glance&n=283155">Musashi</a> caught my eye as I passed by fiction. It's 1000 pages long, and I'm only on page 272, but the end is too near! I want this book to last forever--the story is that wonderful.</p><br /><p>Roopa, Benita, and I trekked out last Monday in hopes of seeing some FotoFest, as I had mentioned, and luckily we passed by the Menil Collection, near which I got to see a great old friend. It stretched its arms out to me; it beckoned to be climbed. I didn't dare, despite my yearning to share in its magic. Would you like to meet my friend? It has the most amazing branches that press into the ground.</p><br /><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/menil_tree1.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/menil_tree1_small.jpg"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/menil_tree2.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/menil_tree2_small.jpg"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/menil_tree3.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/menil_tree3_small.jpg"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/menil_tree4.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/menil_tree4_small.jpg"></a></p></p>
