			<h2>Arts and Crafts</h2>
			<h3>24 April 2006  @ 00:15</h3>
			<p><p>I have spent the last few hours tonight drawing my knee mostly, and a bit of my foot. I had a fun shopping day--I love shopping for art-related things. I bought a mirror, at last, one that I hope I can use for a long time. It still isn't big enough, but hopefully, by the time I decide to get a larger one, I'll have live models to draw other than myself.</p><br /><p>See? I just can't resist. I looked in the mirror and had to draw the torso I saw. It isn't vanity, I promise. I just want to understand, and I can only stare and try to memorize the lines to a degree. In fact, not really at all. Unless I trace what I see from eye to hand, I don't have much of a chance at understanding.</p><br /><p>First I got the mirror and, as I usually do, started comparing my legs, mostly the knees. When I sit with my knees bent up to my chest, it really looks like my left knee is higher than the right. I know my left leg is slightly longer than my right (since before the crash), but not this much! I hope I'm just imagining things. So I spent a while looking through the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0806930152/102-8727877-6165766?v=glance&n=283155">Bridgman book</a>, mostly at knees. Then I spent all night drawing knees by candlelight. Since I don't have lamps, and I can't afford to purchase any right now (especially for such a short stay in Texas), I bought two big candles today. It really isn't enough light, but it's better than streetlamps from outside, or the overhead light in this room.</p><br /><p>I think I understand knees pretty well now. Hmm.. maybe I'll post a drawing or two, why not. I sort of drew in a line for the scar in the first one.</p><br /><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/knee1.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/knee1_small.jpg"></a>  <a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/knee2.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/knee2_small.jpg"></a></p><br /><p>Okay, okay, maybe I don't understand knees that well. I'm not a great artist or anything.</p><br /><p>I became interested in drawing arms, too, but since I draw with the arm, it's hard to pose and draw simultaneously. *Sigh* I've gone through years of trying to model for myself, and it's always a pain. Luckily, we now have such things as digital cameras. But even with this convenience, I just can't bring myself to draw from a photograph. Also the photograph seems more interesting as a photograph rather than as a drawing. Anyway, enough talk, here's a picture I like:</p><br /><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/mirror.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/mirror_small.jpg"></a></p><br /><p>I like that it forces you to realize that it's a body reflected in a mirror, not the real body, and that you can't see the eyes. I love cropping images to where the eyes don't show. It feels like the subject wants you to understand him from inside.</p><br /><p>Earlier this afternoon, I shopped at Hancock Fabrics (great store!) and bought some red sportswear fabric, thick and sturdy, some polyfleece stuff to act as lining, and some velcro. With an iron (the lining and velcro were heat-fusable), scissors, and fabric glue, I made a case for my laptop:</p></p><p><p><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/case1.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/case1_small.jpg"></a><br /><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/case2.jpg"><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/320/case2_small.jpg"></a></p><br /><p>So much fun today!</p></p>
