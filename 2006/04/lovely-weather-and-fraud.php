			<h2>Lovely Weather and Fraud</h2>
			<h3>07 April 2006  @ 17:30</h3>
			<p><p>What a breeze today! I thought Chicago was windier (and it might be, on average), but even Chicago isn't as windy as, say, Dodge City KS, Amarillo TX, or Rochester MN. Earlier in the day the warm summery winds blew the clouds around, suggesting rain, but only providing shade in the end. It always does that here. I love this ever-changing, capricious weather; it so well describes my childhood. Ii omoide!</p><br /><p>Kyou mo ii omoide ni naru koto da to omou. Master Swim class pushed me to swim better than ever before, to take notice of every stroke and fluid movement. I found I could keep up with the two good swimmers, Owen and Gearhardt (sp?), so now my new goal is to try to keep up with them. They can kick much harder than me (understandably), and they are taller and have longer strokes. But my stamina seems to be about the same as theirs. I didn't take much notice of anyone else in the class.</p><br /><p>My fraud case finally has a police report number and an investigating officer will be checking it out. I had received an invoice in the mail a few days ago, from Hollister.Co, one of the online companies from which the fraudulent person ordered a stupid T-shirt. The notice had *gasp* a recipient address somwhere in Humble, TX. In fact, I'll post the complete address:</p><br /><p><em>Tristan (they used my last name)<br /><br />831 Wilson RD #66<br /><br />Humble, TX 77338</em></p><br /><p>And does this address check out? Yes, my friends, it does. I looked it up on trusty <a href="http://www.usps.com">usps.com</a> and got this standard format:</p><br /><p><em>831 WILSON RD APT 66<br /><br />HUMBLE TX  77338-5027</em></p><br /><p>The bastards. If only they knew who they were messing with. If any of you live in Humble, kick this person's butt for me, please.</p><br /><p>Because I still haven't heard back from Equifax after I had called them to request a fraud alert be placed on my file, I called TransUnion today. They have a <em>much</em> better answering system which actually asks if you've moved in the past two years. I have, several times, and of course there's no way I can know what address of mine they have on file. So I guess between three different addresses, and they think I'm just lying. It turns out they think I still live in Maryland (hoo boy!) but they will be sending me information at my current address in a week. I wonder how much damage those idiots have done to my credit this past month. At least I have a good excuse for not being able to contact the credit unions earlier.</p><br /><p>But that excuse is quickly vanishing as today I walked around by myself up and down a parking lot. Nick and I had just walked a bit (me hobbling on his arm), and my foot and ankle stopped hurting after a while. It felt so great that I tried a few steps on my own--almost natural. I keep saying almost almost, but really I must be further away than I think.</p><br /><p>I'm curious about how much my walking around is helping and how much it is hurting. Is there really hurt that you can't feel? Or does that only happen to people who are blind to their own insides?</p><br /><p class="dream">Why have comments not been enabled for the past two posts? Blogger is not letting me publish them. I've been manually updating the page, and because blogger creates a ridiculously highly formatted atom feed, I'm not even able to decode it to update it. If this continues, another day, I will create my own atom feed and update it manually. And in that case, comments will probably cease to be enabled until I write my own commenter code.</p></p>
