			<h2>Fun Week</h2>
			<h3>13 April 2006  @ 10:00</h3>
			<p><p>So much has happened that this past week couldn't have been a worse time for Blogger to stop working.</p><br /><p>Last Thursday, April 6, I saw Nick for a couple of hours. We visited his friends in Sugar Land, Sam, the painter, and David, the breakdancer. From Sam we got printouts of some paintings he had done recently. I love his freedom of color. It makes me feel free, too. I wish I were surrounded by more artists. I always miss art classes and wish I could be in an art school. But art school is such a waste of money (in my case). I can't justify paying that much to learn something that can better learn on my own.</p><br /><p>I might have learned a little more about relationships this past weekend. They come in all shapes and colors. They work best when they are allowed to take whatever shape they want and when minds do not impose limits or expectations on them. Right now, I feel an imbalance of effort in my relationships because I ask too much of my friends and family to help me. I feel guilt and obligation, both of which stem from a fear that if I ask too much, they will stop wanting to be nice to me and the relationships will fall apart. I can't read the other person's mind, and I can't know what they think or feel. I know I need help sometimes, everyone does, but I feel forever indebted to those who help me.</p><br /><p>It's a little demoralizing.</p><br /><p>My painful experience has made me realize that I would go to great lengths to help someone I care about, without any feeling that the other person owes me something in return. How would I communicate that to the person who needs help? "Don't worry about it, I feel completely satisfied just from helping you. The payback is in the action of helping." Would that person believe me? Is this how the people who help me feel? It is how I feel, anyway. I wish I could surrender completely to that feeling and release the guilt.</p><br /><p>Last Sunday, April 9, I went to an art/photography exhibit called Fotofest. I wanted to see Alfredo Jaar's work specifically, but the website said it wasn't open on Sunday--but in fact it was! Oh well. I must go soon. I'll post photos of the photos I saw. The highlights of the show: a bunch of hanging female headless bodies, and a photojournal of Ozyorsk, Russia, a closed city under constant nuclear radiation from plutonium plants.</p><br /><p>I like that artists are responding to violence but I'm not sure what they're accomplishing. Making a statement about violence is not an assignment, like okay make some art about violence, Go! I wonder what kind of a difference they think they're making.</p><br /><p>I would make art about violence that forces the viewer to actually be violent or make a vital decision between two types of violences. Something that skewers them unexpectedly. Maybe you'd learn more if you were forced to be violent and then made to think about what you had done.</p><br /><p>So that Fotofest day I walked around without crutches, but I had to hold onto someone's arm most of the time. Monday, APril 10, I went to the gym with crutches just to save face, but I made my final farewell on Tuesday evening after the doctor OK'ed it. That evening I took a <em><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/walking.mpg">video of me walking</a></em>. It's 9.48 MB.</p><br /><p>I took <em><a href="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/walking_heels.mpg">another video</a></em> (3.85 MB) on Wednesday morning of how I ambulate in heels--much easier because I don't have to push with the metatarsals as much (where most of the pain is). It feels like I haven't walked in months, which is the truth.</p><br /><p>I've been seeing many jaw/teeth-related doctors lately. I'll need a prosthodontist for implants, an orthodontist for braces, and an oral maxillofacial surgeon for overall jaw health and progress monitoring. The most urgen thing right now is cleaning my teeth--dentist time! I can wait a few months to get implants and braces because the bones need to settle and heal completely. I'm not even sure I want temporary teeth, since it's only cosmetic. Its functional qualities wouldn't change too much about how I eat, since I've been eating satisfactorily so far.  Although the root of the front tooth is dead, the tooth isn't rotting yet and I can still use it to bite into soft things--even ripened pears!</p><br /><p>I don't care what people think of me when they see my missing teeth. It will make for good conversation and weed out the stupid people. :)</p><br /><p>Yesterday's therapy had me doing some really fun things, like standing on one leg, the right one, for 30 seconds, standing on only the right leg while playing ball with a medicine ball and a slanted trampoline, and squats. The therapists were tickled by my progress. I love that everyone loves my attitude--it eggs me on. And honestly, genuinely, I have nothing to be sad about anymore. It's like since I got hit, I've become happier than I've ever been. Did it kill some brain cells responsible for sadness? Will this last forever? Time, as with everything else, will tell.</p></p>
