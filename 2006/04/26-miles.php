			<h2>2.6 miles!</h2>
			<h3>17 April 2006  @ 07:20</h3>
			<p><p>I thought we only walked a measly 1.8 miles or so last Saturday, but no, it was <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=126955">2.6 miles</a>, a la gmap-pedometer. Of course, in my case, subtract about 0.2 miles or so for the distance that Nick carried me on his back. It was a fun walk. I'll remember the mosquitos, the waddling ducks following us, the blue-ribboned trees, DNA and chromosomes, and frustration-heart-talk.</p><br /><p>Last night I went to a Carnatic music concert. (Back up: I've been studying the tradition, <a href="http://music.solostyle.net/">went to India</a> to learn intensively). The vocalist was Sudha Ragunathan, who has been famous in India for over ten years, but whose music I only started appreciating last night. I've been to a few of her concerts and they always left me quite cold, as if she was only interested in acrobatics and winning applause. But last night, her erudition and devotion to the heart of Carnatic music showed through every line she rendered. She's one smart woman. I had a feeling she might have grown out of her acrobat stage by now--the reason I went in the first place.</p><br /><p>Also my parents let me drive there and leave when I felt like it.</p><br /><p>I must eat breakfast soon, since Mom and I are going to the gym in a few. After Nick and I had walked a mile or more, my knee started to get stiff. Walking makes it fluid but only up to a point, I guess. So I think I'll practice some Tai Chi stances to make my right knee stronger and more fluid.</p></p>
