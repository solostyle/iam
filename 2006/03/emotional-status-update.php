			<h2>Emotional Status Update</h2>
			<h3>21 October 2007  @ 19:10</h3>
			<p><p>At least hunger &gt; pain. As long as that is true, I am well. The training for the triathlon is kicking my butt right now, because I'm getting so down on myself. I know I have the stamina and power to swim a mile, no stopping, in forty minutes, but I can barely do four laps before I need a breather. When my leg hurts, I tense up and try to make extra-controlled kicks in a movement that uses my leg less and my back more. How discouraging!</p><p>Shhh... you must promise not to tell anyone important (of course <em>you</em> aren't important, no one important reads this thing anyway), but I've been trying daring tricks with my leg that you kids shouldn't try at home. Last night I tried walking without crutches. Don't do it, kids! I might start walking sooner than those fogies thought. They'll see me on April 11, and I'll already have started running.</p><p>I can do handstands now.</p><p>I know I said I would lay off the tricks, but I feel so good, and I only push myself as much as I think I can handle.</p><p>I wish I had some peace and quiet in this house. Because my grandparents are here, and they're bored, and hard of hearing, they watch television all day at high volumes. I can't stand television at any volume. I want so much to sit and just listen to my heartbeat for hours. I like to do nothing but sit and breathe. But what can you do when you live with people who need constant stimulation?</p><p>Everytime I see a new doctor, the story gets retold. And everytime it gets retold by my mother, the issue of "catching that bastard" gets reiterated. But today for the first time, my mother said that she's been noticing me since the day I got hit, and that I never once uttered vengeful thoughts toward the perpetrator. She says she thinks that amazing. I smiled and felt a gush of warmth and happiness. It wasn't even because of what she said, but because I realized I can't be angry at anyone. No matter how I think about it, I'm filled with joy, and I don't quite understand where it comes from.</p><p><img src="http://iam.solostyle.net/img/640/open_mouth_convo.jpg"></p></p>
