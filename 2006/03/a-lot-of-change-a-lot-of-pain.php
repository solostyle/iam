			<h2>A lot of Change, a lot of Pain</h2>
			<h3>21 October 2007  @ 19:07</h3>
			<p><p>Something I've noticed throughout the healing process: Whenever there's a major change, the adjustment period is painful. After that period, it feels normal again. The only exception to this was just after the hummer hit me. My whole body went numb and I couldn't even feel myself hit the ground. I only felt my body flying through the air. There was no adjustment period here because the shock was so great that my brain shut off sensory receptors. The pain lasted only for the split second of impact.</p><p>Notable periods of adjustment:</p><ol><li>Every time I had to be transfered from one bed to another, my leg and hips would hurt like hell. After several minutes on the new bed, the pain would normalize again. This is when I first noticed the adjustment period. In the beginning I dreaded being transfered, but then I trusted the adjustment period more and more and braved it.</li><li>After the leg surgery, the pain gradually grew to a maximum that made me nauseous. They had ordered me not to eat 10 hours before the surgery, so I didn't make a mess, but I refused to eat anything, which is worse. It was the greatest pain I have ever felt. I can't believe I can actually say that. Whee! Believing that the pain meds were causing the nausea, and being staunchly anti-medication, I refused to take Dilodid. I went in and out of semi-consciousness for a couple of hours, hoping it would die away. But it got too unbearable. The nurse, Mitos, told me it wouldn't go away, it was a major surgery, I have to take medication. She said, "That's why we put the machine rigbt by your bed and give you a button to dose yourself with at anytime." (I know a few people who would dig that!) Anyway, I took it finally, but only the bare minimum, until the pain was lowered just enough to let me sleep. But the next morning, I realized I hadn't slept well, and I heard that therapy was going to start soon. "Oh shit!" I thought. "How do people let themselves be moved while in pain? Pain meds!!" So early that morning, I dosed myself until I felt almost no pain and forced myself to sleep for at least three solid hours. This kind of thing continued for another two or three days and nights. Once they got me on crutches--the fourth day after surgery--I had stopped taking medication. I knew that every time I had to move my leg, it would definitely hurt, but the pain either died down or I began to understand the intensity and duration of pain I could expect.</li><li>They took the brace off my leg two weeks after surgery. Ouch! The stabilizing muscles in the leg had not yet activated to protect my knee. A day of adjustment for this and I was fine.</li><li>The maxillofacial surgeon took the bands off my teeth and made me open and close my jaw a few times. Then he put new bands back on and let me go. It felt like he had twisted my teeth in the process, because even slurping through a straw hurt my gums for a couple of days. Only 5 days until these bands come off! Two of them have already broken off (with a little *ahem* help).</li><li>Leg lifts! I thought I got them down the first time, when I still had the brace on. After they took it off, I had to re-re-learn how to lift my leg. Each time of relearning took about a day (and effort).</li><li>Working out atrophied muscles in my body. Right now I'm feeling the kind of soreness I felt in 7th grade when I first tried to lift weights. Except I feel it everywhere. I have never been sedentary, so I'm not used to this pain. I can't understand how people can go through periods of not working out for longer than three days--voluntarily! But this, too, is an experience that has illuminated much about the body.</li></ol><p>In a few weeks, my leg, hip, glutes, hamstrings, etc, will have to relearn how to work in unison toward a higher goal: walking!</p><p>And now for something off-topic. Today my horoscope on <a href="http://www.astro.com">astro.com</a> includes the following:</p><blockquote>Socialize extensively and study the people you associate with, for they are a reflection of yourself. What is true of your friends is also true of you, for the most part.</blockquote><p>That's definitely true, but horoscopes are usually not this meaningful. It's so direct and insightful. Bold, adventurous people write <a href="http://www.astro.com">astro</a> horoscopes.</p></p>
