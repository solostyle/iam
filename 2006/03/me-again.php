			<h2>Me again</h2>
			<h3>21 October 2007  @ 19:10</h3>
			<p><p>See, that previous post was aptly titled "not me" just so that I could wake up this morning, reread it and say, "yup, that's someone else." But it is true that sometimes I feel down, sorry for myself, and that I don't deserve life. I sometimes stare into space and can't believe that I'm alive. I used to do this years ago, and people probably thought I was crazy.</p><br /><p>Today's adventure? It's nothing like what I've been through! Peanuts! In fact, this morning, I have quite the opposite sentiment about the entire thing. It's freedom!</p></p>
