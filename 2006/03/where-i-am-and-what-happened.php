From that moment, I knew that so much would change and that my plans and dreams for the future might be completely smashed. I thought I had died even though I was awake, since I don't know what death is. I won't go into the details because there are so many other things going on right now. It's difficult to start writing because I want to stay in this moment and yet I feel I need to fill in all the details of the recent past. Other people have written about it, so let's see what they say:</p><br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/02/21/43fab14ba1cbe">Yellow Hummer hits student</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=:ePkh8BM9E2IF2mHACaLyDFgh9gDZGRChXAhVYsAKswMAh-4Gmw/5-0&fp=44079769883bd06a&ei=ke0HRNP2G4WuoQKu_Lgw&url=http%3A//cbs2chicago.com/local/local_story_053213644.html&cid=0">Yellow Hummer Sought In Hit And Run Accident</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=:ePkh8BM9E2IF2mHACaLyDFgh9gDZGRChXAhVYsAKswMAh-4Gmw/7-0&fp=44079769883bd06a&ei=ke0HRNP2G4WuoQKu_Lgw&url=http%3A//cbs2chicago.com/topstories/local_story_053111650.html&cid=0">Public Asked To Help ID Hit-And-Run Driver</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=:ePkh8BM9E2IF2mHACaLyDFgh9gDZGRChXAhVYsAKswMAh-4Gmw/1-0&fp=44079769883bd06a&ei=ke0HRNP2G4WuoQKu_Lgw&url=http%3A//www.dailynorthwestern.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/02/23/43fd4ec3aec8c&cid=0">EPD looking for Hummer that hit student</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=:ePkh8BM9E2IF2mHACaLyDFgh9gDZGRChXAhVYsAKswMAh-4Gmw/0-0&fp=44079769883bd06a&ei=ke0HRNP2G4WuoQKu_Lgw&url=http%3A//www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/northshore/chi-0602230152feb23%2C1%2C5826967.story%3Fcoll%3Dchi-newslocalnorthshore-hed&cid=0"><br />Yellow Hummer sought in hit-run</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=:ePkh8BM9E2IF2mHACaLyDFgh9gDZGRChXAhVYsAKswMAh-4Gmw/3-0&fp=44079769883bd06a&ei=ke0HRNP2G4WuoQKu_Lgw&url=http%3A//www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/wi/02-23-06-840796.html&cid=0">Hummer hits NU student</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=:ePkh8BM9E2IF2mHACaLyDFgh9gDZGRChXAhVYsAKswMAh-4Gmw/2-0&fp=44079769883bd06a&ei=ke0HRNP2G4WuoQKu_Lgw&url=http%3A//www.dailynorthwestern.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/02/27/44029006251dd&cid=0">Evanston bike paths lacking</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=:ePkh8BM9E2IF2mHACaLyDFgh9gDZGRChXAhVYsAKswMAh-4Gmw/4-0&fp=44079769883bd06a&ei=ke0HRNP2G4WuoQKu_Lgw&url=http%3A//www.dailynorthwestern.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/03/01/44053781cb7f4&cid=0">Fast bikes; hard heads</a></li><br /></ul><br /><p>Right now I'm at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, located in downtown Chicago, sharing a room with a stroke patient who has constant diarrhea, bed sores, anxiety and fear of losing her blackened toes, and no family or relatives. I got transferred here for physical and occupational therapy after St. Francis Hospital in Evanston, where I was first admitted after the crime, discharged me. We're here two to a room, sharing a bathroom, a curtain, and occasional conversations. </p><br /><p>I've been improving much to my satisfaction and surprise. A few days after the accident, I still had not been out of bed, lying there in a perpetual stupor and moaning every so often. I remember many visitors and their cheerful insistence that my positive outlook would get me through this. Is it my silly naivity that keeps me from realizing the gravity of this situation? It doesn't seem that grave to me. I knew I had no choice but to dream narcotic dreams and smile with friends when we squeezed hands.</p><br /><p>In the beginning it was mainly a battle of restlessness. The first night after the jaw surgery I knew too little to care enough to feel anything emotional. There seemed to be no pain from after the surgery and I knew I wasn't on large quantities of painkillers. Then I waited around in bed impatiently until the leg surgery. The day before the surgery I became so restless that I decided to use my body as if it were mine again--that is, try lifting myself off the bed, twisting, and touching my toes with my knees straight. I practiced until it became painless. </p><br /><p>But I haven't always been positive. The first time I really cried was just after the leg surgery. Even during the surgery I was nothing less than a ball of sparkles, chatting away with the surgeons and anaesthesiologists about anything and everything.. how many kids they had, what they're doing, how much I wanted to see what they were actually cutting down there, etc. After the pain wore away, a burning sensation at the site of surgery grew and grew until it became nauseating. I thought it was interesting and finally requested pain medicine. But neither morphine nor toridol worked. </p><br /><p>Finally I was wheeled back to my room, where my mom waited, and in front of her I could no longer hold it back. I cried and closed my eyes, unable to bring myself to ask for more medication. I was convinced that the medication was making me nauseous. They had me hooked up to a push button with which I could administer my own narcotic analgesic--the superpainkiller dilodid. The first biggest step of trust took place here: the nurse argued that the pain was the nauseating factor, not the drugs, and urged me to take them. So I decided I had to try something and took it. It worked! I slept well and forgot about the leg.</p><br /><p>It's still difficult to trust doctors and nurses. If something they say doesn't jive with me, I can't help but be skeptical, knowing full well that they might be right. Then again, there are instances where I feel that I am more right, that I understand my own physiology better than them. For the most part I have to grit my teeth and just go with it, tolerate whatever they want to stick into me or make me drink. I do have some control--for instance, I've become so much better after the leg surgery now that I don't need pain medication anymore. So I refuse it every time it's offered. I still feel pain but it's nothing like pain after surgery. That is something completely out of this world. I remember telling my friend at the time that heartbreak was definitely worse, because nothing hurts more than heartbreak, but for physical, completely non-emotional pain, that leg pain was extreme. The pain I feel now is just from jiggling my leg around in ways that it protests even though they're not harming it. My leg needs to get used to the movement.</p><br /><p>This is getting to be too lengthy but something phenomenal happened today. I started to move my right leg using only the muscles in the right leg! The first time I would have to lift the leg with both hands underneath the knee to move it. Slowly I learned to wedge my left foot underneath it and move it that way. Then I learned to hold onto the brace with one hand and lift it that way. Today during physical therapy they gave me leg exercises designed to help the muscles of the injured leg. The therapist told me when he had a leg surgery, immediately after the surgery, the doctor told him to lift his leg off the table. He said, "What? I just had surgery, how am I supposed to do that?!" But the doctor grimaced at him and said, like a drill sargeant, "LIFT! And do it 100 times a day!" The therapist told me he lifted it three times that day. THREE times. I couldn't even think about moving it after my surgery. </p><br /><p>After the therapist's story (I'll get his name tomorrow), I got reminded of my beloved Master Choi, my Tai Chi master. He would tell me similar things, like doing an impossible exercise an incredible number of times, so that at least I would do them a pretty impressive number of times. So today, I decided I would lift my leg at least once. It didn't quite work during therapy session, but when I came back to my room, I tried it again, and after much concentration and grunting, I sort of got it. Then I practiced dragging my leg to the left and to the right without using my hands or my left foot. Amazing! With a little pain, it is possible! I can do it. I know I can get better quickly. Nothing is going to stop me now.</p></p>
