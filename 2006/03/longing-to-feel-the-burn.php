			<h2>Longing to feel the Burn</h2>
			<h3>21 October 2007  @ 20:08</h3>
			<p><p>I make it a point to eat before writing in this blog because I can't do anything when I'm starving. Oh, these past two weeks at home have brought me wonderful food. That's the best part about being home. It's tasty food that I grew up eating, so it feels like home to eat it again.</p><p>I need to work on my temper. I've been so irritated lately, and I flare up at my parents too often. The littlest things get on my nerves, but I know deep down I actually love the things that make my parents do those little things. Why can't I understand that <em>in the moment</em> rather than right after I flare up? Perplexes me.</p><p>This morning I went to the gym with my mother for the first time in quite a while. The original purpose was for swimming, but I won't get my swimsuit until after my free pass ends; and then I am not going to become a member at this gym because it's $100 just for the first month. Bullshit, is what I say. The gym isn't even that great. The pool is tiny. They have tons of fun machines, however, and they have adjustable stationary spinning bikes.</p><p>I used the bike and the machines today, but I didn't get tired at all. I just got bored of being on the bike because I wasn't feeling a good workout. I am not allowed to put much resistance, either. Then during therapy (after the gym), I got on the stationery bike--this one was recumbent--and felt a satisfying burn in my glutei. I wonder if there was more resistance on the latter bike, and I wonder if recumbency aids in activating those muscles.</p><p>I can sit Indian-style more comfortably now! It feels wonderful to be able to do that. I tried doing the butterfly, where the soles of the feet are pressed together and knees pressed flat on the ground, and I can almost do it as well as before the injury. I can also put a shoe on the right foot now, because the edema has decreased, but the nerves on the top of the foot over the big toe are so sensitive that they burn when anything touches them.</p><p>My right leg and foot are also slightly darker than my left. Probably also because of stagnant blood and edema.</p><p>The incision scars are getting darker. Before, they were pale pink, just like new baby skin. The PT said it's good that they're getting darker--it means more blood flow. For the past two days, I've been applying Vitamin E and Aloe, rubbing and massaging it in. Now's the time the scar tissue really begins to form. Massaging keeps it laying flat until it breaks and dissolves away.</p><p>Two or three weeks ago I couldn't even lift my right leg isometrically. Today, the PT put a two-lb weight around the ankle and I had no problems lifting! As I was lifting today, this thought excited me and made me smile. I heart therapy!</p><p>The ROM on my knee is finally at the point where it actually <em>feels good</em> to move it around and get the aching soreness to go away. All this time it has hurt and hurt, as if my muscles were wound so tightly that they'd tear under tension.</p><p>The PT's at this rehab center in Sugar Land (TIRR) have a little device with two electrodes that measure the voltage of your muscle contraction. They put the electrodes on the thigh, one near the knee, another about 3-4 inches higher. You contract and hold, and the lights on the little voltage meter run up and down depending on your contraction. When I first used this on the 13th, I got up to an average of 60 microvolts, and my maximum hit was around 90 microvolts. I used it again two days ago (Monday) with an average of 80 and a max of 110 or so. Today, my average was 160 microvolts! Where did that massive strength come from? And the maximum I hit was 180 or 190. I think having worked out a bit at the gym ahead of time loosened my quadriceps and made it easier to contract them.</p><p>Since I worked out and probably tore a lot of muscle today, I've been trying to eat a lot of protein and antioxidants. I pureed a block of tofu, 3-4 tablespoons of organic peanut butter, several tablespoons of flax seed oil (not protein, but good fat!), and some soy milk to loosen it up. It was divine. It had the color of hummus and the consistency of yogurt, but it was far more delicious than either. I had some berry smoothie thing with 500% DV of Vitamin C, too.</p><p>I have more exercises to add to my list, and I might document some interesting pureed recipe solutions for people who love to eat but who can't.</p></p>
