			<h2>"Amazing"</h2>
			<h3>21 October 2007  @ 20:08</h3>
			<p><p>The only reason I'm in any pain at all right now is because I'm sitting Indian-style, cross-legged on the floor. I saw my new orthopedic doctor, Dr Bloome, this morning about recovery and the next steps toward getting back on both feet. He was amazed at how quickly I'm recovering and how motivated I am to get better as quickly as possible. He was impressed at what a perfect job Dr Gordon had done with the surgery. (Yay!) He also said that with the new kind of metal plate they put in my leg, the wait before weight-bearing is usually six weeks rather than twelve. But because Dr Gordon recommended twelve weeks, Dr Bloome compromised seven or eight weeks. He wants to see me on April 11, three weeks from today, to get another Xray and talk about walking.</p><p>I got a much larger and clearer view of the fracture from the Xrays today. Actually both the tibia and fibula had completely broken. There was a little fuzziness around the fibula's break which he said was the new ossification. So cool! I couldn't tell whether or not there was visible ossification on the tibia.</p><p>I'm now officially allowed to put my right foot down for balance if needed, but as you all know I've already started doing that. Although it may be true that there might be harmful stresses you can't feel, and that putting weight on the leg might cause abnormal bone growth, it turns out that I'm healing perfectly and the weight I have been putting on the leg thus far probably has not been damaging.</p><p>If I can start walking by mid-April, then I get a good four months to train for the Chicago Triathlon in late August. Dr Bloome said going to the gym and practicing some swimming would be excellent for recovery. It will build muscle without stressing the joint, he said. But also I know it will get the entire body working together fluidly--and help me train. I'm also allowed to get on the stationary bike (as I have been doing at PT anyway). More training!</p></p>
