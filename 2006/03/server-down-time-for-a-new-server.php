			<h2>Server down, time for a new server?</h2>
			<h3>21 October 2007  @ 19:07</h3>
			<p><p>I got this in the mail today. I think it's time for a new server. I've been considering <a href="http://www.mediatemple.com">mediatemple.com</a>. I know they're pretty reliable, but they aren't too cheap.</p><blockquote><p>Dear Customer,</p><p>We regret to inform you that SupremeCenter7.com, the server that your account is hosted on, is experiencing downtime due to a file system error that requires the file system to be updated. This was the reason for the problems with the server for the past 2 days as well, and our Technical Department is working hard to have the web hosting services up and running in the next couple of hours. During this period, your websites, e-mails and the rest of the hosting services will not function but no data will be lost and you will have the services restored without any impact on the data stored.</p><p>We are aware that it is crucial for you and your business to have the hosting services working properly and will do our best to have the server up and running as soon as possible. We thank you for your understanding and patience regarding this matter!</p><p>Best Regards,<br>SupremeCenter Support Staff</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, you're welcome for my understanding and patience, but this is not cool. TWO DAYS? I can understand if it's for a few hours. Not to mention that they only managed to send out a notice that they're experiencing problems TWO DAYS after they start experiencing the problem. Does it really take that long to figure out that there's a problem? Shouldn't customers be the first to know if it affects them? Bah. My hosting subscription ends in April. A change may be due at that point.</p></p>
