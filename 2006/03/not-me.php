			<h2>Not me</h2>

			<p><p class="dream">When I was younger, in my teens, I would marvel at each and every day.</p><br /><p class="dream">I wondered how there could be so many days, one after another, seemingly forever.</p><br /><p class="dream">Would the days get tired of coming? Would I cease to keep each day straight? Would I die once they ran into each other and became indistinguishible?</p><br /><p class="dream">If there are so many days, how culd I ever keep track of them all and remember them? And if I can't remember them, what is the point in living them at all?</p><br /><p class="dream">Why try, each day, if in the end it just becomes a string of faceless days?</p></p><p><p>I still feel that way, but now the endlessness has become far too great for me to fathom. If I started to try to fathom, I would feel overwhelmed and time and life would become incomprehensible. But still, even today, I want so much to cherish every day and every moment. I've always been this way. To live with care and carefree, to decide every moment and see to its core.</p><br /><p>Whether or not I remember it all, at least I know I am here now, because I was there then, and have always stayed in the moment. Every moment is a universe unto itself, reflecting other moments through eternity, jeweled, shimmering, fluxing.</p><br /><p>Tonight I lay on my bed, lights on, sheets over my head, head sunk in a pillow, eyes open, staring at nothing. I can feel my pulse in my ears. It shakes my entire body with every beat. And my vision shakes, too.</p><br /><p></p><pre>My body<br />            a pool of water<br />The pulse of my heart<br />     pebbles dropping from an invisible hand<br />The moon's glassy eyes illuminate<br />this pool to its<br />                very<br />                    depths<br />Oh, but would that I had those eyes!<br />Mine are<br />     clouded with<br />             fear and uncertainty<br />The only way<br />   is to do what my heart aches for most<br />To lie<br />    at the banks of this body<br />                              in silence</pre></p><p><p>I'm sorry. I ask my body to forgive me for putting it through this pain, this mess. Stay with me.</p></p>
