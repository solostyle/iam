Maybe they're pretty convinced that I'm healthy like a normal human being. I'm just unable to walk with both feet.</p><br /><p>So Ruth finally got moved. Just this afternoon. I wonder who the newcomer will be. There will be no one else in this room tonight. That will be interesting. I might actually sleep. Oh, shut up, solostyle... stop being so rude. I did sleep all right last night. I had ear plugs in and was unaware of the constant diarrhea that afflicted my friend the entire night. But it will be easier to drift to sleep tonight, nonetheless.</p><br /><p>She couldn't have kids. She had lived with her husband in a beautiful house on a 2-acre lot and had to move out due to her husband's illness. After he died, she got a stroke and ended up here. She's ashamed of her blackened toes, always complains that her hair is messy and ugly, and has an eye for pretty clothes and jewelry. She loves my mom's gold jewelry from India because it's so unique. She told me this morning, "I'm sorry I kept you up all night. I had bad diarrhea but I couldn't help it." And I told her, "Don't worry about it, Ruth. I had earplugs in, and didn't know a thing. You're going to get better." See? I'm not that mean.</p><br /><p>Then later, Evan came to visit and we talked about bikes. He had just gotten his new Fuji track bike, a sweet piece of machinery, something I would love to ride. After he left, Ruth asked me about him and about my biking hobbies. "You sure get a lot of visitors, it's nice that you have a lot of friends." And I told her a lot of the people who come are fellow bicyclists and some of them I don't even know that well. But it's great that the biking community is so strong here. I belong here. So I asked her if she had any hobbies. She didn't want to go into them. "I used to, but not anymore. I've given up on everything now." It sounded like she wanted to die. And in fact... this morning she did say.. "I just want to die," and started crying. If I could only get up.. I wanted to hug her.</p><br /><p> Just yesterday she was so proud of herself because she got up to her feet and walked between the parallel metal bars in the gym. That's amazing. She bragged and bragged and I was really proud to hear that. See? When people are positive like that, I gain more and more respect for them. I think that's when I first began to like her. Then later that day she started having a wet, growling cough and the afore-mentioned intestinal problems. I think it broke her spirit. Moving her out of the room with me-- I, who represent youth and vigor and life, with my flowers that "still look fresh," and my stream of visitors--moving her away from me and into her own private room, I think, to her, symbolized some kind of death sentence.</p><br /><p>She needs a spiritual doctor, not more medication. She's already taking 22 pills and several shots (for anti-blood-clotting, for various other things). She has diabetes and has to take insulin and blood-sugar-regulating medicines. She fears the pain of the injections. But she's in this condition because her husband died and she feels loss. It's more than physical. For me, it's different. My emotional pain is next to nothing because... I just feel strong and--like I said--this isn't heartbreak. She's a lovely woman. Gosh, I feel for her.</p></p>
