			<h2>Toward Independence</h2>
			<h3>21 October 2007  @ 20:08</h3>
			<p><p>At this point, if need be, I could live alone in my apartment in Chicago and get by without any outside help. I took my first shower standing up. Now that I can put my right foot down (without any weight, of course), my standing balance is better. I can climb stairs. I can carry a lot of weight in my messenger bag while using crutches, so I could go grocery shopping, too. I can keep myself entertained with jigsaw puzzles, drawing, and other things. I can work out at the gym independently, as well. I can make my own food by boiling, if needed, and grinding things. The basics are completely possible.</p><p>At the gym I did four miles in twenty minutes! I started slow, but my last mile was 3:40. That's pretty good considering my left leg was doing most of the work. But if my right leg thinks it can just loaf along, it better rethink. I'm going to put it through the most tortuous training it could never imagine once I'm allowed. For now, I've been working on making my back and abs super strong. RAWR!</p><h3>The Truth about Food</h3><p>I'm starting to gain a little more weight, or it could be the natural fluctuations in body weight that I notice. I'm somewhere between 108 and 110 pounds. (Why am I publishing this information?) The interesting thing is that because it is difficult to eat most things, I tend not to eat very much in general. Most people will go out and get something to eat if they're hungry. Roopa and I went out to a cafe last night and I just drank some rice milk that I had brought with me. Because it's a pain to go to the bathroom in public places, I don't feel like drinking very much when I'm out. And because drinking is all I can really do, that means I don't consume anything.</p><p>The even more interesting thing is that when you have to drink everything, you see food for what it really is. Mind you, I was already health-conscious prior to this ordeal, but even for me, things have become clearer. Imagine everything you eat, pureed. Pureed chicken, anyone? How about pureed cookies? Believe me, it just turns to sugar and doughy lumps. Pureed Taco Bell? </p><p>If I were teaching a class, I would assign my students to keep track of what they eat everyday, every time they put something into their mouths. Then I would tell them to carry around a portable, battery-powered food processor or blender (maybe I'd rent them out to them?) and puree everything before eating. Seems like a useless experience, but maybe something about food would become clearer.</p><p>Even today, I wanted to try pasta and veggies with some sauce, a pretty normal meal. I pureed the pasta and the veggies/sauce separately and tried to mix them together as I slurped. The pasta was unpalatable, while the sauce and veggies were scrumptious. I could just eat pasta sauce and vegetables, forget the pasta! I think I might try pureeing everything I eat just to see what I really like and what depends on texture.</p><p>Rice is still delicious.</p><p>Many of you may not know this, either, but when your jaw is wired shut, your tongue is trapped behind rows of pearlies. And actually who knows whether or not their backs are still pearly, since you can only see the fronts. The caged tongue might be more tormenting than you imagine. How I long to scrape the white stuff that has probably built up on it these past five weeks! A dirty tongue can make food taste a little different, even though at this point, I fail to notice any difference. I try folding it over itself and rubbing in an attempt to clean it, but sometimes that only makes the bulid-up more apparent.</p><h3>"Aw, poor guy!"&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sorry, Sir."</h3><p>How many times do I have to tell people my story? People at the gym ask all the time, cash register workers, even parking lot workers. And it's not flattering when they confuse me for being male. Come on, people, I have breasts! And hips! Open your eyes, I'm not a man! I do not understand. The next time it happens, I'm going to purposefully confuse that person for the opposite, too. Women are generally prettier than men (just look at the movies--many male actors are not that handsome but there's no ugly female actor). People mistake me for being male. Therefore, I'm probably a bit uglier than most women. Ahahaha, I can live with that!</p></p>
