I answer, "Fine!" Sometimes with annoyance, sometimes with eagerness. I'm hot and cold. I know I really want to be nice, I know I really care, but for some reason I get selfish and don't want to be talked to or bothered. My mother and I discussed this one night before she had to leave and she told me it's only when you get older and have more difficult experiences that you begin to deeply care about other people. Young people (like me) tend not to have the patience or compassion and simply get annoyed. I told her that sometimes I feel like a mean person, and even though I know I <span style="font-style:italic;">can</span> help it, some rebellion in me refuses.</p><br /><p>Sometimes I just don't want to answer my "next door" neighbor, Ruth Pavlovich. She's lonely, sad, and trying her very best. She's caring, considerate, and warm, too. They say they want to move her to a private room because of the diarrhea, and she doesn't want to go--she likes me so much. That's when I feel the worst! I want to love her, too, and now I'm starting to feel sorry that she might be leaving this room. Who knows who else might show up. I should learn something from this: that no matter who shows up, I should try to be loving and kind.</p><br /><p>I feel really silly now. I'm a stupid young 22-year-old with no heart, with a heart of selfishness and immaturity. My 66-year-old future self laughs at me.</p></p>
