			<h2>I am a victim of multiple crimes</h2>
			<h3>21 October 2007  @ 19:07</h3>
			<p><p>I was hit by a hummer who sped away at the scene of the crime. Then, and this was out of my own irresponsibility, I left my wallet on the airplane from Chicago to Houston and it has been stolen. My checking account has been charged multiple times for charges totalling a few thousand dollars--all of which have been reimbursed by my wonderful bank.</p><p>Additionally, I thought I was really smart for keeping my Social Security card with me at all times in my wallet, until now, of course, at which point I feel pretty stupid. The thief has my Driver's License and SS# now and may have tried opening various cell phone or other types of accounts in my name. I've requested a fraud alert be placed on my credit stuff but I'm already a victim, so really I should get my SS# frozen. In order to do that I have to write to each of the three major credit bureaus (it's a French word, so why don't people say bureaux?) individually to get each of them to freeze my credit files.</p><h3>Update:</h3><p>I just called the police and they came by. Mr A Soriano of Sugar Land told me that by placing the fraud alert on my account I have pretty much done everything I can do. I only need to request a credit report and make sure no new accounts get opened or anything. If something like that does indeed happen, then I am offically a victim, and I can have the Security Freeze placed on my account at no charge.</p><p>I just hope I actually get the information from Equifax, with whom I had placed the fraud alert, in the mail successfully. They have my Maryland address--not even my Illinois one. If they had had my Chicago address, at least Kevin could go by and get my mail for me. But I'm not even sure that the USPS is still forwarding mail to me from Maryland. In any case, I've filed a COA with usps.com to forward all my MD mail to TX now.</p><h3>OK, come on, let's hear some good news</h3><p>Good news? Heh. All right, fine. The good concerns two things that have happened recently: my sister's wedding, and my rehab.</p><p>Recent developments in the rehab process:</p><ol><li>I can bend my knee 142 degrees. The goal is 155 degrees, which is how far my left knee goes. It can never be 180 because there is fat, tissue, bone, and fluid between the two axes of the angle (formed by the femur and the tibia). On March 7, it was 67 degrees. On March 8, it was 72 degrees. On March 9, it was 88 degrees. On March 13, 106. On March 15, 116. Today, 142.</li><li>Last night I couldn't sit Indian-style with my legs crossed and my right knee resting completely flat against my left ankle. Today it is comfortably touching my left ankle, but sitting like this hurts. That's a huge improvement in only 13 hours. Now I can meditate sitting with my back straight! How exciting! My right knee still isn't completely pushing down against my left ankle.</li><li>The wedding ROCKED. My sister, Aparna, was so amazingly beautiful and her groom, Dipak, so light-hearted and excited. They were like little kids. An enormous amount of toil went into making it as successful as it was. I only got to see the last week leading up to the wedding. The phones would ring off the hook--all three of them, and sometimes the same person would have to answer all three. I was just hopping along whining about being hungry constantly.</li></ol><p>... and the wedding:</p><ol><li>People liked my toast, most importantly my sister. I had it all written out, and I had read it a few times over but when I stood to speak, things came naturally, and I never looked at my notes.</li><li>I met some really cool people, including Eric, Cast, Joe (super cyclist!), Reed (super ex-racer, casual cyclist!), Jason (and his sister Jesse), Sean (my fellow drummer and artist), and a bunch of other people.</li><li>I saw Ritu and Rani Goradia--friends from eleven years ago. ELEVEN! I didn't even think I would ever see them again. I always wondered about them and how they were doing, but never contacted them. I hung out with Ritu the most out of everyone there. My lord, I can hardly believe it. Now that I'm around Houston, she and I can hang out much more often. What a world.</li><li>I spent quality time with my sister on the dance flo'. The music was cool and everyone was enjoying him or herself. I think everyone had some quality timez. Ye-yeah.</li></ol><p>*Sigh* It's time to relax. Or so I thought until I checked up about this identity theft business. The fun never ends!</p></p>
