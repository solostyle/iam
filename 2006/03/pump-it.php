			<p><p class="post"></p><div style="clear: both;"></div><p>This morning's leg exercises were killer on my good leg. It felt like one-legged biking. The right leg is just sad. The kinds of exercises we do are slow and controlled with a lot of resistance, which is good for buildling slow-twitch ability and muscle mass. But what about quickness? Am I going to lose all that?</p><br /><p>Even with the exercises they have me doing now, my heart rate doesn't go up, I don't get tired, and I'm not working all the muscles I want to work. Tonight I'm going to hop around on crutches until I collapse (not literally!). All right, 2 minutes until my arm exercise class.</p></p>
