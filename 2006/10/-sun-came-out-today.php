			<h2>The sun came out today</h2>

			<p><a href="http://solostyle.net/about/resume3.pdf">Resume</a> (pdf).</p><p>Messages that you decide never to send are sometimes evidence of interesting inner turmoil, in this case, of a battle between honesty and restraint. A photojournalism student from the <a href="http://www.dailynorthwestern.com">Daily</a> wants to take a picture of me and get to know what happened to me. My response:</p><p><blockquote>So this story is basically about the accident? The Daily has written a bit about it, so maybe you could read those before meeting me, that way we don't have to talk about that all over again. I've actually turned down two stories, one from the Asian News Network (who are they, anyway?) and another from the Chicago Tribune--I turned them down because I'm kind of sick of all the media. I know it's for a good cause, to give other people hope or whatever, but I feel like they can never know what it's like and it's not just a "story" for the media. And everytime I talk about it, I feel like I have to rehash the whole thing, when really, I just want to move on finally.</blockquote></p><p>Shortly after, I started crying uncontrollably and had to save the email as a draft. I don't even like to talk to people anymore. Last night a friend of Darian's at the coffeeshop brought it up and I raised my voice a little saying, "I <em>don't</em> want to talk about that." Well, sometimes it's true, I don't. The familiarity that has already been established between friends provides enough comfort to me.</p><p>I've arranged a mock interview on Monday for which I'll have to get a suit. And shoes? Ugh. Feet and posture are way too important and fragile to wear something feminine that looks nice. Maybe I shouldn't worry about it and just wear sneakers for the mock one, so as to keep my feet as healthy as possible. I might have to suffer for the main interviews. Lately, my fracture has been acting up worse than before. Kinda worrisome.</p>
