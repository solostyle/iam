			<h2>Job Searching</h2>
			<h3>12 October 2006  @ 23:10</h3>
			<p>Juggling job searches, ameliorating my resume, constructing a better portfolio, attending doctor appointments for multiple problems several times a week, getting surgery (tomorrow), insurance issues, and classes is getting to be hard. None of these things is less important than the other, so I can't simply prioritize. What a hassle.</p><p>Do I have any friends out there who are resume gurus? Can you take a look at mine and comment? See the comment link below! </p><p>Here it is in <a href="http://solostyle.net/about/resume.pdf">PDF</a> format.</p>
