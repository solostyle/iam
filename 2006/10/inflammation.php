			<h2>Inflammation</h2>
			<h3>31 October 2006  @ 20:14</h3>
			<p>The past is catching up to me.</p><p>No one knows how hard I worked during the spring and summer when I was training for the triathlon. The podiatrist makes it sound like I did something phenomenal that my body might not have been ready for. </p><p>My running workouts were few and far between. I'm thinking on the order of 3 times a week at the most. I spent most of my time biking and swimming. When August rolled around, I stopped exercising for a few weeks because I didn't think I would or could swim in open water.</p><p>A few weeks after the triathlon I started marathon training. I pretty much stopped biking and swimming because running took up all my time. I did the training for something like 4 weeks before the pain in my foot became unbearable. I think it was <em>this</em> training, not the triathlon training, that messed me up.</p><p>I'm taking a corticosteriod to reduce the inflammation present in <em>both</em> feet, under the lateral sesamoid bones. Apparently, one can live with a stress fracture, and many runners continue to live with them, though they may not run much.</p><p>All right, so. I think I may have a future in running, but it may be several years before that future comes into view.</p><p>For now, I just want to get back to walking again, dammit.</p><p>In the meantime, I'm rockin out on my bike, everywhere. I wonder how crazy the night looks downtown. I'm supposed to work on this paper that's due in three weeks, but I can't stop thinking about getting out there on my bike. Should I ditch the paper and do it?</p><p>Damn this cortizone! It's giving me a headache and making me tired. If anything makes me tired, it should be <em>me</em>.</p>
