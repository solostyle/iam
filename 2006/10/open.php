			<h2>Open</h2>
			<h3>29 October 2006  @ 11:37</h3>
			<p>This morning I got the urge to open up my hymen.</p><p>It was great. I got my whole thumb all the way in. It would be much easier to do this with a dildo than with my hands. Which hurt after a while. It tried to get more than my thumb in, like another finger, but there's no more room in that hole. I could put it in the other hole, but what good would that do? Then I'd just have two mildly stretchy holes, neither of which are stretchy enough. </p><p>I worked at it for a long time and discovered that vaginal stimulation can be very pleasurable when done in a certain way. I found that it feels way better when I sit on my fingers to push them in, not as much when I just push my fingers in. And it only really feels pleasurable when I contract my muscles around my fingers rather than just move my fingers in and out.</p><p>It's too bad that most of the time sex is a guy putting his dick into a vagina. Lame. It's so much sexier when you engage your whole body and use different muscles to arouse yourself. Then it becomes real sharing rather than just using one another. How nice. It would be like sharing your experience of arousal with someone else.. </p><p>Well back to my paper...</p>
