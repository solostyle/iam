			<h2>Archana for sale</h2>

			<p>I have a whole new resume that I'm working on now. I'll upload it for everyone to ogle and drool over. Although lengthier than I had hoped, it elaborates on the value of my accomplishments. It isn't quite at presentation quality yet, but I will upload it soonish. I should finish it by the end of the week.</p><p>In other news, I just saw Dr Cloe, the dentist, this morning/afternoon. The travel took a total of four hours, plus the appointment time, which was almost two hours. I cannot get any work done during my travels, either, because it's split up and the weather makes things uncomfortable. Dr Cloe took some impressions, and the new partial dentures will arrive in three weeks. He also attached a new tooth-like shape on my old set of fake teeth, which keeps falling out of my mouth because of its <em>poor design</em>. "This is just for looks, now. No biting bread or chewing," admonished he. It's perfectly okay with me. I have been eating soft food lately, anyway. (Except for apples, can't resist the apples, gotta have apples.)</p><p>And amazingly, I haven't been getting stared at as much! People just look at me the way they normally do, with that suspicious stare and an occasional smile. I suppose it's a Rogers Park thing. I think I will still enjoy scaring people by popping my teeth out suddenly.</p><p>I'm all toothed and jazzed up, but I'm still hard to buy.</p>
