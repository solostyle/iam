			<h2>It never makes sense</h2>

			<p>Where are my standards? Often I find that anything I do can be interpreted across a wide range of criteria and that multiple possibilities exist for judging the quality of my work. When you complete a project (essay, art piece, program), shouldn't you be able to judge it as mediocre, good, or excellent? My own judgments of my work used to be so clear to me, and often they would coincide roughly with the judgments of knowledgeable people. But lately, and it's been worsening, the range of judgment that I can give myself is so wide that I have no idea if my work is terrible or adequate.</p><p>So I turn it in to some professor, some knowledgeable person whose opinion one can trust, and hold my breath for his judgment. I'm an alien to this planet all of a sudden, and I have no idea what standards people use to measure quality. It sickens me to think that my ability to self-judge is so weak and impaired. I compare myself to far greater work in relation to which mine seems effete, and yet I can also see its inherent value and its superiority to less competent work. But because I know of the poorest and greatest qualities of work, the range is so vast that I cannot place mine anywhere on it definitively.</p><p>Have I lost sight of my standards? Could I take this more as a liberating reality than disconcerting one? I got an email from my American History of Gay and Lesbian Culture professor (Lane Fenrich--terrific guy) saying that my paper was the best in the class. But the class has a bunch of graduate students and adults in the Continuing Studies program--how can this be? And I have no understanding whatsoever about Gays and Lesbians. I just see them as people, I guess, but I don't really feel like a part of their culture and therefore a bit alienated from it. The material is difficult and it took me a long and frustrating time to write the paper; and at its completion the only satisfaction I felt resulted merely from its completion, not its quality. Remember, I can't even judge quality. So how the hell is my paper so good? Or rather, what's wrong with my sense of judgment?</p><p>There are certain things that I can judge properly, I guess. When I make art, I can usually feel satisfaction or ambiguity or some unequivocal feeling (yes, even ambiguity is definitive). And if someone else feels differently about my work, they're usually not a good artist or I just don't agree with them anyway. It doesn't bother me so much what they think because I can cast their opinions off as inconsequential. But this kind of thing only works for things that bring me personal satisfaction. If it's frustrating <em>and</em> unrewarding, then there's no telling how good or bad it is. I just can't see it. </p><p>I guess any academic school project would fall under that category of judgments to which I'm blind, because ultimately, it doesn't quite matter what I think. All I can do is what I do, something honest, organized, and deeply contemplated. Like this blog. Again, I feel that my writing seldom grazes the fringes of masterful prose, but who cares as long as it's from the heart?</p>
