Yesterday evening was usurped by website redesign plans. When bedtime rolled around, it was still too early for the ideas that had just awakened. I tossed in</summary><author><name></name></author><updated>2009-03-10T19:28:00Z</updated></entry><entry><title>Lessons of a healer</title><link href="http://iam.solostyle.net/entry.php?id=tag:iam.solostyle.net,2009-03-07:/2009/03/lessons-of-a-healer" /><id>tag:iam.solostyle.net,2009-03-07:/2009/03/lessons-of-a-healer</id><summary>I learned some good lessons yesterday, as well. Sharon and Dr. Rugg share an office space with a group of physical therapists called Midwest Physical Therapy. The therapist who works there the most, maybe he is the only employee, is kind of an annoying character.

It's amazing to realize that it took eleven months to diminish my need for adjustments from twice a week to once a month. As Dr. Rugg said, there worse things to be resigned to than a life of exercise.

Everything feels like it's going too slow. I feel like my brain is going too fast!

I jogged and/or ran to the gym, lifted weights, and walked and/or lunged back. The weather is kissably sweet. I want to be outside forever and more.

I could bench press more than usual, even though I hadn't pumped iron in a week. When I say bench press, I mean with individual weights, not the bar. I normally do 20 lbs on each side, but yesterday I could do 25 lbs.

Some time later, I tried it again but more intensely. I focused very hard, cheered myself on, and felt an enormous pop in my right hip. After that, it was sore but relieved.
